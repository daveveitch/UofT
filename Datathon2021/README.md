This folder contains the final report and supporting code for my winning submission to the 2021 Citadel-Correlation One PhD Datathon. 

The Datathon took place over one week, so it was a bit of a rush to complete it. As such the code is poorly commented.

Of potential use to others, in the folder eda the files hypothtest.R, and locallinear.R are implementations of the paper Testing Parametric Assumptions of Trends of a Nonstationary Time Series - Biometrika (Zhang, Wu 2011). One has to run locallinear.R first in order to produce .MM matrix files which are then used by hypothtest.R.

Thank you to Citadel and Correlation One for putting on a great event.
