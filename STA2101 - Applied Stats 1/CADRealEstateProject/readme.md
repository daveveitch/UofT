A project I did on sentiment analysis of newspaper articles, a few notes.

The writeup can be found in 'STA2101 Final Project - David Veitch.pdf'.

A HTML file containing the code used in the report can be found in 'STA2101 Final Project - David Veitch - Code.html'. Note this does nto contain the code used to produce Figure 2.

A Jupyter Notebook with the code used in the report, plus the code used in Figure 2 can be found in TextAnalysis.ipynb. Note that the topics in this Jupyter Notebook do not 1:1 match those used in the report. This is because after the report was submitted, Figure 2 was changed, and in doing so the random seed that generated the original topics was lost. So essentially this Jupyter Notebook should only be used to look at the code used to produce Figure 2.
