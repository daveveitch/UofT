Written and directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson, who guided Ms. Swinton to a more effective performance in the 1998 &quot;Conceiving Ada,&quot; &quot;Teknolust&quot; has a lot on its mind but little on the ball when it comes to transforming thematic notions into dramatic concepts.  The most aggressive of the clones, Ruby, becomes infatuated with an irritatingly incompetent copy shop employee (ok, we got it) played by the perpetually twitchy Jeremy Davies.  Love, it seems, will help her to become real, like some sort of hormonally charged Pinocchio.  There's some potential for entertainment here, but Ms. Leeson's emphatic direction draws much of the fun from the comedy elements.  Even Ms. Swinton, usually the most restrained and elegant of performers, can be found mugging outrageously as she strains to put over the less-than-convulsive laugh lines. &#151; Dave Kehr"

Tall, reedy, manically energetic, Spoddy identifies with wild birds, and considers himself a cross between a hunting falcon and an endangered snowy egret.  He is given to long-winded, self-righteous denunciations of his fellow humans for what he perceives as their blind conformism, which makes him a very irritating person to be around.  Frequent cutaways to soaring sea gulls suggest that Spoddy is a spirit in desperate need of liberation.  &quot;Attitude&quot; is the fifth installment in a series of works that Rob Nilsson has created with the Tenderloin Group, an actors' workshop that he helped to create at a halfway house in San Francsico's Tenderloin district.  Largely improvised, the drama evolves before your eyes, sometimes striking directly to a powerful emotion, at other times getting lost in fussy actorish moments. — Dave Kehr"

Mark Ruffalo's Jack, who teaches literature at a small college, is having an affair with Edith (Naomi Watts), the wife of his best friend, a writer named Hank (Peter Krause), who has a fling with Jack's wife, Terry (Laura Dern). It is all a bit too symmetrical — a bedroom farce without a sense of humor — and the characters float free of any credible social context. But this dark, cracked crystal of a film nonetheless works as a kind of marital film noir, with the threat of emotional violence hanging over every scene. The actors give brave, unshowy performances, especially Ms. Dern, who lets go of any trace of actorly vanity, and Mr. Ruffalo, who portrays male weakness with an honesty rarely seen in American movies. — A.

Imagine the Grace Kelly of &quot;Rear Window&quot; or the Kim Novak of &quot;Vertigo&quot; sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. The movie establishes a mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. The running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink (Fabrice Luchini) is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant.  Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, located  on the same floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult practices a few doors  away.  The movie takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy, in other words, in the realm of film itself. In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, it is seriously light.

Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by E. Elias Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think &quot;Seven&quot; minus the talent. Soon after the agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cacti and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. As Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, it soon appears that the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not. — Manohla Dargis"

The director has a fine sense of place and regards the quirks and delusions of this remote rural town with a native's mixture of affection and impatience. The film, written by Mr. Hess, a 24-year-old former student at Brigham Young University, and his 23-year-old wife, Jerusha, works best as a series of deadpan visual and verbal gags. Even the trained actors in the cast perform with the hesitant, awkward opacity of non-professionals, and their awkwardness is clearly, for Mr. Hess, a sign of authenticity. His own considerable talent could use a bit more polish. There are some dull stretches, and the fairy-tale ending does not seem entirely earned.

A prequel to &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Stellan Skarsgard as the same character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks, but when push comes to demonic shove hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup just as surely as some producers hath no shame.

A computer hacker (Diego Luna) takes a break from spying on his neighbor to go in on some shady business with Russian mobsters, and the ensuing wave of grisly, jokey violence sweeps up the unsuspecting proprietors of a modes beauty salon and a small pharmacy.

She and Daniel (Daniel Travis), her boyfriend, out for a morning of scuba diving, have been left behind by the charter boat, and they bob up and down, fighting panic, exhaustion and each other in a desperate struggle to survive. The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too under-dramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort. Susan and Daniel are so bland that they could be anybody, which is the problem, and your sympathy for them is fleeting, as if you had encountered them in a short, grisly item on the local evening news. — A.

The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived in for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because &quot;The Graduate&quot; established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through  &quot;American Beauty&quot; and beyond, you expect &quot;Garden State&quot; to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, &quot;Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one. — Stephen Holden"

The humans don't have much to do in &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them.

Even vicariously you can feel the rushes of adrenaline.  Because the waves get progressively higher as &quot;Riding Giants&quot; goes along, some of that thrill is sustained, although the movie is too long. For all its excitement, Stacy Peralta's follow-up to his skateboarding movie &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; lacks the quirky, personal touch of its forerunner. Though it has its share of cheek, it is a more formal survey of a sport that is already well documented. The history of surfing, one commentator remarks, can be divided into eras: before and after &quot;Gidget.&quot; The closer the movie draws to the present, the more concentrated is its attention to innovative stars like Greg Noll, Jeff  Clark and Laird Hamilton and their quest to ride the biggest, scariest waves. &#151; Stephen Holden"

A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a one-time San Francisco teenager-turned-old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Garry Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and written by Shonda Rhimes, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2&quot; combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake too. — Manohla Dargis"

Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, &quot;Collateral&quot; scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of our selves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously crafted commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith. — Manohla Dargis"

Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, the plot-heavy movie draws you against your will into its malignant force field. Almost from the  beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another  way, &quot;Little Black Book&quot; would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed &quot;Working Girl&quot;  and a more acerbic &quot;Broadcast News.&quot; In trying to be both things at once, it can't hold a candle to either forerunner.

The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino  Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory  into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms.  Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of  fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromises but never  undermines her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing. &#151; Stephen Holden"

Jon Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama — especially when Eddie and Marion commence their affair — but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-sized portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need. — A.

Although its publicity goes out of its way to pat the movie on the back for its supposed candor about Porter's homosexuality, the film's attitude toward sex is dainty. The heat in a film about the man who wrote &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; remains a steady, air-conditioned 68 degrees. It can't imagine a wealthy, sophisticated couple marrying for friendship and social advantage without that arrangement involving torment and guilt over its lack of sex. Some two dozen Porter songs are glossed by contemporary singers like Elvis Costello (&quot;Let's Misbehave&quot;), Alanis Morissette (&quot;Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love&quot;),  Sheryl Crow (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;) and Diana Krall (&quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;).

Denzel Washington plays Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran haunted by nightmares who tries at once to hold onto his sanity and to unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Liev Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Meryl Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly.

As ever, Mr. Shyamalan uses the classic techniques of movie suspense (and James Newton Howard's sinister score) to conjure an atmosphere of mystery and dread, which vanishes even before the big plot twist sends the picture spinning into silly, pretentious allegory.

The movie is a sub-sub-&quot;After Hours&quot; odyssey in which the title characters, while stoned on a Friday night, catch a galloping case of the munchies from a television  ad for White Castle burgers and embark on an all-night search through the wilds of New  Jersey for the nearest outlet. Along the way the pair is menaced by a gang of extreme sports punks, a rabid raccoon and a computer-generated cougar they use as a getaway horse.

The carelessness with which the director hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of a last-ditch marketing:  grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. Lashing out in all directions, the director addresses white collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; harangue the next, &quot;She Hate Me&quot; can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh.

After nearly 20 years together, Metallica was in something of a funk, and they hired Phil Towle, a therapist, to help them through their artistic and interpersonal struggles. At its core, &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; is the portrait of a marriage: the angry, sustaining partnership between James Hetfield, the lead singer, and Lars Ulrich, the drummer, who founded the band as teenagers and must figure out how to keep it going now that they're in their 40's. &#151; A.

This time, it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jess must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine.   Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.

There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Matt Damon as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who can't remember his name or exactly why he's being hunted by everybody. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format.

That ghost haunts the movie's troubled young  protagonist Alim (Jimi Mistry), a gay South Asian Muslim leaving with a British lover in  London. The movie is the latest manifestation of an already stale sub-sub genre: the  multicultural romance in which a gay couple of mixed ethnicity tries to conceal their  relationship from visiting tradition-bound relatives who assume the lovers are  heterosexual roommates.

Will Smith, in weary-action movie mode, plays Del Spooner, a homicide detective in 2035 Chicago investigating the death of an old friend. Spooner is a confirmed robot-hater, and as he confronts his bigotry the movie develops a clever, if obvious, racial subtext. With the help of Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), a concerned scientist, and a soulful machine, named Sonny, Spooner contends with an apparent corporate conspiracy aimed at usurping human control of everything. &quot;You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met,&quot; Spooner says to Dr. Calvin at one point, and for a dumb movie, &quot;I, Robot&quot; turns out to be pretty smart. — A.

Eileen and her two adult children try to cope with the crisis as best they can, but a pesky F.B.I. agent (Matt Craven) keeps stirring up the past, in the form of Wayne's adulterous relationship with another of his workers.

After a difficult birth, the mother abandons her calf, refusing to nurse it. In the wrong hands &#151; probably any other hands &#151; &quot;Camel&quot; would drip with stickiness, and it verges on being an old-school live-action Disney feature. Yet Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni deny us the easiness of narration that spells out what their cameras are ably, and simply, filming. They have said they were inspired by the pioneering documentarian Robert Flaherty. This movie follows Flaherty's mission to capture traditions of cultures far from his own. Though similar in motivation, it is modest and leisurely, rather than epic and obsessive like Flaherty's films. The filmmakers' patience and the quality of the images they obtain give a mellow contentment to the project, a thoughtful and honest serenity that is passed on to viewers. &#151; Elvis Mitchell"

The central  character, Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), forsakes a carefree life in Stockholm to assume  control of his family's floundering steel works after his father commits suicide. Part of  the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother (Ghita Norby)  and his beautiful wife (Lisa Werlinder), who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from Stockholm to Copenhagen. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute. As he turns the business around, his decisions tear apart his family and erode his marriage. You can read the Danish film as an unsettling parable about any corporation, or, for that matter, any country forced to take stringent financial measures to avoid catastrophe. For all the pain he inflicts, Christoffer might even be seen as a self-sacrificing hero. But as the morose movie shows, a corporate hero is many ways the antithesis of a humanitarian. — Stephen Holden"

This time he plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego newsman whose supremacy is threatened by the arrival of a woman (Christina Applegate) who becomes his rival, his love interest and, of course, his straight man. The movie's ideas are none too fresh — the crazy sideburns and ugly neckties of the 1970's will only yield so much hilarity — but there is a reasonably high quotient of funny jokes and off-the-wall, nutty gags, including a street fight among rival news teams as amusing for its movie-star cameos as for it brutal slapstick. — A.

His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifying Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Sam Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and MJ (Kirsten Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued. — A.

But once you accept the anthropomorphic premise that a gentle pussycat lurks inside of the most ferocious tiger, the movie succeeds as an inspirational pastorale and passionate moral brief for animal rights and preservation. It also inveighs unequivocally against one culture's looting of another's historical treasures. The movie isn't as gripping as the director's much-loved 1988 film, &quot;The Bear.&quot; But when it concentrates on its animal stars (each played by several tigers), it remains on solid ground. Guy Pearce is a treasure-seeking marauder and big game hunter who softens and considers abandoning his rapacious ways. &#151; Stephen Holden"

Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of the screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (James Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Gena Rowlands) suffering from Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be.

A full frontal lobotomy might be a good place to start.

What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Steven Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness. — A. O. Scott"

This seductive Italian film uses the image of beautiful strangers secretly and obsessively studying each other through opposite windows, to reflect on two related romantic syndromes, the &quot;grass is always greener&quot; and the &quot;absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; quandaries. Instead of encasing the characters in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, the film compares the fantasies of possible lovers (Giovanna Messogiorno and Raoul Bova) to the romantic, six-decade-old memories of a mysterious octogenerian (Massimo Girotti), whose story gradually comes to focus.

Affecting the pseudo-macho bark of a drill instructor, he suggests Tony Robbins as a shrimpy, steroid-enhanced gym rat.

It tells the curious story of what happened to Parsons's body after his death: his road manager, Phil Kaufman (Mr. Knoxville) spirited the coffin away from the Los Angeles airport and drove it out to the desert, where he had promised to set in on fire. Kaufman is pursued by Parsons's grieving, straitlaced father (Robert Forster) and one of the singer's gold-digging ex-girlfriends (Ms. Applegate). Unfortunately, the most interesting character is the dead guy, and the movie is too flat-footedly anecdotal to reveal why anyone would care so much about him.

The sight of a dilapidated woman besotted with a careless young  god in his 30's may be uncomfortably taboo busting. But the extraordinarily clear-sighted  and psychologically balanced British drama stares as calmly at May's perilous leap into churning emotional rapids as a medical show does when keeping its gaze fixed on a tricky surgical procedure. The bravery of Ms. Reid's screen performance can be measured by her utter  lack of self-consciousness when naked before the camera. When desire trumps May's  maternal feelings, and she knowingly (and guiltily) risks exile from her family to pursue  a hopeless infatuation, she is achingly believable. Hanif Kureishi's screenplay is infused  with an unwavering Chekhovian compassion. Neither good nor evil, its characters are  complicated, ordinary people coping as best they can with their emotional wounds and  their fear of the future, grabbing at illusions of salvation and whatever zest they can drag  into their lives, even while suspecting that the most passion can provide is a temporary  quick fix. — Stephen Holden"

The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high tech environment, machines used to be funny.

In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by David Twohy, who directed  both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready taglines. Intoned by Vin Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing.

The director Brian Dannelly resists easy, smug caricature, but the picture ultimately fails both as comedy and as sentimental melodrama, veering from not-very-funny jokes to canned speeches about tolerance and human fallibility. This is a shame, since the bright young cast (especially Mandy Moore, relishing the chance to play a villainous, self-righteous teenage queen be) performs with conviction and high spirits. Jena Malone plays Mary, who becomes pregnant while trying to cure her gay boyfriend and whose crisis separates the pious hypocrites from the decent folk.

Some of the chapters are almost vanishingly slight —  hipster anecdotes that float away like smoke rings. Others —  notably a hotel bar encounter in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and a resentful cousin and a game of celebrity one-upmanship between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan —  have the compact perfection of good one-act plays.

In answer, this intelligent, hectoring documentary offers an elaborate psychopathology of dishonest, unscrupulous and predatory behaviors, which are seen as expressions of the corporation's fundamental nature. Case studies in environmental pollution, aggressive branding, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of technology alternate with more general disquisitions on the brutal logic of global capitalism. The talking heads are mainly activists and scholars — Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, among others — with a few C.E.O.'s and orthodox economists thrown in for balance. While much of the material is persuasive, the film ensnares itself in contradictions it does not acknowledge, and paints a grim, tendentious picture of the modern world. Even Marx recognized the creative, liberating force of capitalism, and without some acknowledgement of the comforts, conveniences and pleasures that corporations provide, it is hard to understand their power or, for that matter, to oppose it effectively. — A.

The look is grainier and grimier, and the themes are a bit darker and more unsettling than in &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; or &quot;Chamber of Secrets.&quot;  There is less Quidditch and more Snape, which is all to the good, as are the efforts of new cast members like Michael Gambon (taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson (as a batty divination teacher), David Thewlis (as the latest defense-against-the-dark-arts master) and Gary Oldman, who brings his adaptable villainy to the title role. The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Daniel Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue, demands. Still, Mr. Cuarón breathes some new life — and a new sense of mystery — into a series whose charms are in danger of declining due to over-familiarity. — A. O. Scott"

On the fast track to A-list Manhattan insufferability, she lives out a dreamy, sanitized version of the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; lifestyle, partying all night, then skipping into the office all a-bubble with nifty little notions that anticipate her boss's every whim. Her life of fun, fun, fun comes to a screeching halt when her older sister and her husband are killed in a car crash, and the will gives Helen custody of three orphaned children. The rest of the movie tells the warm and fuzzy story of Helen's bumbling surrogate parenthood to the brood she inherits, and her discovery of family values and true romance in an outer borough. The movie pretends to address the practical issues of single parenthood in New York but is far too skittish to do more than bring up a problem or two, then solve it with a magical sitcom-ready wave of its wand. — Stephen Holden"

All of which adds up, in the hands of Roland Emmerich, to a  sprawling, oddly light-hearted action picture. The computer-generated special effects are awesome, though not in the traditional sense of the word. As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think &quot;My God, how horrible&quot;; you think, &quot;cool!&quot; The only one who seems genuinely worried is Dennis Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late. He sets out to find his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is stranded at the New York Public Library and who seems, all in all, pretty relaxed.

The rococo fantasy, tricked out with animation and with actors sailing like little Supermen through toy cutout clouds, belongs to the same school of whimsical excess as  &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; and &quot;Amelie.&quot; But as the movie glides along, its story turns considerably darker than its fluffy, candy-colored forerunners. Narrated by its  protagonist (Guillaume Canet), the movie follows the increasingly destructive games of one-upmanship he plays over three decades with his closest childhood friend (Marion  Cotillard). The two meet as 8-year-old children and enter a private world in which  they dare each other to carry out increasingly outrageous pranks. On one level, the movie  is a parable of the battle of the sexes. On another it portrays the insanity of any romantic  quest (they love each other but can't say it) in which the postponement of fulfillment  becomes a desperate end in itself. &#151; Stephen Holden"

Filmed at a mountain lake in a South Korean nature preserve, it follows an elderly monk and his young acolyte through the stages of the life cycle and the seasons of the calendar. The placid surface of Kim Ki Duk's lovely film is disturbed by eruptions of intense emotion, occasionally verging on melodrama, and by an intrusive soundtrack. But the film, with its moments of sharp humor (and the beguiling appearances of a white cat, a wry turtle and a quizzical rooster), is both sensual and austere, an exercise in spiritual discipline that sharpens your perception of human nature and the natural world. — A.

Movie stars, spies,  government ministers and jailbirds collide in a panoramic gridlock when the advancing  German army threatens Paris and the city's upper crust flees en masse to the Hotel  Splendide in Bordeaux. The film, with many subplots, blurs the line between comedy and  epic drama so adroitly that the two styles fuse into something quite original: a lyrical  farce that pays homage to its period in any number of ways.

Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first &quot;Shrek.&quot; There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders), and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal — slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grownups — is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed.

It isn't, but it's not so bad either. Yes, the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious, but Wolfgang Petersen and David Benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously. Brad Pitt, in spite of an odd pseudo-English accent (perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly British and Australian cast), plays Achilles with wit and charisma, turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star. Eric Bana, as Achilles' Trojan counterpart and nemesis, Hector, has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with Mr. Pitt's brashness. Some of the battle scenes have a vigorous old-time grandeur, and though it takes some inevitable liberties with the source material, the film is more astute about the political and moral complexities of war than most recent combat pictures. — A.

In 1989, just before the fall of the German Democratic Republic, Christiane (Katrin Sass) sees her son beaten by police during a riot. She falls into a coma and the Berlin Wall — and all that implies — collapses during that time. &quot;Mother slept through the relentless triumph of capitalism,&quot; Alex notes. Any sudden shock could kill her, so Alex contrives to keep her convinced that things are still the same. Alex has to rescue the paste-board furniture that he and his sister were happy to heave onto a junk heap; the utilitarian design of the furniture seems to inform us that East Berlin may have been where Ikea got its ideas from. There are a few bright jokes and sharp observations in &quot;Lenin!&quot; Alex's determination eventually pulls in everyone he knows; instead of paying off East German officials for better supplies, he's now giving money to kids to dress as Young Pioneers — the East German equivalent of Boy Scouts — to serenade his mother. His boyhood idol — a cosmonaut who now occupies a reduced station in life — becomes part of the imposture. And his best friend and fellow satellite television installer recreates old-school newscasts. The laughs grow out of the elaborate lies they have to construct when Christiane inadvertently glimpses the new world.

Shortly after Hong Jong-Du (Sol Kyung-gu), the learning-disabled middle brother of three sons  in a bourgeois Korean family, returns home after serving three years in prison, he  meets the more seriously disabled Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), who suffers from cerebral  palsy so severe she can't make herself understood. The passionate bond that develops between them brings them joy but leads to personal disaster. The film's extraordinary lead performances refuse to soft-pedal the severity of their afflictions. By not turning away, softening or adopting a saccharine tone, the film breaks through the couple's  isolation (and through our own prejudice and frustration) so that the sweethearts emerge  as full, achingly human characters. &#151; Stephen Holden"

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But it does add a be-yourself finale that, while standard for such movies, this picture doesn't quite seem to buy — it's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teen queens who rule, through subtle terror, the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since Cady was home schooled by her zoologist parents, who raised their daughter while traveling in Africa. Since most of &quot;Girls&quot; consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is great home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical &quot;S.N.L.&quot; newscast. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of &quot;Girls&quot; — as a series of moments, it works better from scene to scene than as a whole — the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions.

Mr. Caviezel's bland impenetrability may fit the screenplay's portrayal of Jones as a ferocious competitor who internalized stress and suffered physically for it, but his muted presence fails to create a compelling character. The movie, which wants to ennoble golf with the same spiritual mystique that &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; brought to running, is even more hushed in tone than its prototype.

After Adam dies in a horrible accident, his grief-stricken parents are approached by the eminent genetic scientist Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) at the cemetery. Wells pounces on Paul and Jessie with his procedure to produce a perfect duplicate of the dead son from one of his cells.

And any movie that telegraphs its fondness for its cast automatically has something going for it that's rare in contemporary comedy; this isn't one of those movies in which most of the actors steer clear of upstaging the star. This spiritual decency, a handful of songs from the toddler days of MTV and a few other fillips of clear-eyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept, a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult. In this case, it's 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen), who's suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday.  When some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her carefully moussed hair, she awakens from a nap as a 30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer Garner). As acted by Ms. Garner, Jenna has a coltish gawkiness that she never quite sublimates. The obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body, as Jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is.

Tony Scott's annoying camera tricks and souped-up  effects — including English subtitles for English dialogue — are perhaps  meant to make the movie look better than it is.

Its story, which sends the enormous red dog and his pals, Cleo and T-Bone, out on the road with a traveling carnival, is bland and innocuous, as every hint of trouble is quickly turned into a soothing lesson. The gaudy, unimaginative animation is a step down from the simplicity of the series, and adults may find the cloying harmlessness oppressive.

Mr. von Trier is a ruthless provocateur with the sensibility of a practical joker. The ensemble drama, filmed on a stage designed as a map, often suggests a long-winded Brechtian deconstruction of &quot;Our Town.&quot; As a  contemptuous, nose-thumbing expression of the director's misanthropy, especially his  anti-Americanism, the movie is relentlessly true to its hateful vision, which portrays the  ideal of embracing human community (and especially the cozy, cookie-baking dream of  small-town America) as a lie. The only true solidarity to be found in any group, it  proposes, is in xenophobic mob violence. Set during the Depression in the imaginary American town of Dogville, it reworks Mr. von Trier's favorite metaphor for human cruelty — the persecution and martyrdom of an innocent young woman (played by Ms. Kidman) — then subjects it to a transcendently nasty, vengeful twist. — Stephen Holden"

The joy when Quentin Tarantino's creations speak is the opposite. Despite their hilariously florid rapping, his folks are also incredibly cagey: they never give the entire game away. This shrewdness is the template for the long dialogues in &quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 2,&quot; the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made.   In this deliciously perverse picture, everything is operatic, including the despair and the pauses. Uma Thurman, whose speaking voice has a lyric, teasing quality, is just the performer to get the mordant slyness across. Mr. Tarantino's movies are also about loss and betrayal, and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is a double-burger helping of those motifs. It is rich, substantial and sustained, yet also greasy kids' stuff, a wrapper filled with an extra large order of chili fries, stained with ketchup, salt and cheese. &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was all set-up: the longest first act in movie history, staged and edited like a series of Pablo Ferro trailers. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is the second and third acts in one convenient serving, told in a languorous flashback-within-a-flashback style with airy long takes. Unlike the 100-meter high-hurdles of &quot;Vol. 1,&quot; this sequel is a marathon, with hills and long stretches of flatland. As in the first film, the Bride (Ms. Thurman) is on a mission of vengeance after being shot and left for dead; she's out to murder her former colleagues led by Bill (David Carradine). She calls her journey a roaring rampage of revenge. The movie, which quivers with a geek-adrenaline rush, in some ways feels like its time may have passed; this feels likes a movie Mr. Tarantino might have made before &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

Here Connie (Nia  Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette), two  bedraggled female veterans of the dinner-theater circuit on the run from mobsters, become  overnight (and highly unlikely) cult stars by posing as gay drag performers singing  Broadway standards. The movie knows and doesn't care that it has only the most tenuous connection to the real world. As drag performers, Ms. Collette (who at times resembles John Epperson as Lypsinka) is far more adroit at caricature than Ms. Vardalos, whose alter-ego suggests a homier, drag version of Kathy Najimy with a smirk that evokes traces of Mary Martin and Phyllis Diller.

The result is this altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama. The first scene of the picture serves as an announcement of its intentions and is emblematic of the film's approach. Strolling into a restaurant and trilling his consonants as if he were trying to add an extra layer of moss to his accent, the roguish Lehiff (Colin Farrell) wins over the girl behind the counter, and the scene spins wildly into something else entirely. The shock &#151;  both comic and finally horrific  &#151; gives the movie the fizz of unpredictability. Surprise hovers over &quot;Intermission&quot; like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.  What Mr. Crowley and the screenwriter Mark Rowe have done is assemble a group of actors whose feistiness keeps the doom that drips around the corners of the frame from consuming them all whole. The tangle of intersecting lives is what keep the movie thorny, and forces the actors to stay alert.  Though a bank robbery is fundamentally the center of the action, following the characters around is really what &quot;Intermission&quot; is all about. It's as if the movie is an intermission for Mr. Crowley from the rigid demands of plot and theme that crop up so often in his stage work. &#151; Elvis Mitchell"

Anne Hathaway, the vivacious young star of &quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; plays the title character, a put-upon teenager in a storybook world whose widowed father (Patrick Bergin) has injudiciously married Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), the mother of all wicked stepmothers.  She comes complete with a pair of entertainingly hateful daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham), who like nothing better than torturing Ella — particularly once they discover that, thanks to a questionable gift bestowed by a fairy (Vivica A.

As Ella sets out to find the errant fairy and convince her to revoke her dubious present, the screenwriters Laurie Craig, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (working from a novel by Gail Carson Levine) take her through various effects-filled realms, including a land where elves are forced by the evil regent to sing, dance and be relentlessly merry, and a forced labor compound for giants that looks disturbingly like a concentration camp.

This is an accomplishment of sorts, generally the sort that no one plans. The director, John Lee Hancock, strains so mightily to bring a human aspect to the material that the movie limps as if it has a pulled muscle.

That the film contains wildly contradictory notions about sex and pornography — one moment it is celebrating, the next shaking its head in concern — is hardly surprising. Why should it be different from anything else? What is scandalous is how little humor it squeezes out of its sleazy premise. Timothy Olyphant, as a snaggle-toothed hipster who produced Danielle's films, gives the only performance that shows any inventiveness or wit.

This is, at bottom, a lesson in tolerance, but the atmosphere of unassuming realism and the tenderness of the two central performances make it less cloying then it might be, and Mr. Sharif's sly charisma almost rescues his character, who is basically the personification of exotic, enigmatic wisdom, from being a dubious Orientalist cliché. — A.

Guillermo del Toro has brought a similar woozy, disconcerting melancholy to his film adaptation, and his obvious affection and affinity  for that dankness alone would make &quot;Hellboy&quot; worth seeing. But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. What gives &quot;Hellboy&quot; squirmy, ferocious life is the environment that Mr. del Toro creates onscreen. It's this texture that he avidly lavishes on &quot;Hellboy&quot; that offers the kiss of distinction.  It's an elegant haunted house of a picture, with dread and yearning part of the eeriness. Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy, and his mastery of bad-tempered volubility, makes the film a kind of screwball comedy version of the Thing from the Fantastic Four comics. Like any American comedy protagonist, he's always trying to explain himself and do what's right. That ambition is what gets him into trouble and is the truest definition of Hell. — Elvis Mitchell"

In the new film, the action has been transposed to Washington State (probably to allow the producers to shoot in the budget-friendly confines of British Columbia), and the Southern sheriff has become a Special Forces veteran who returns to find his hometown, once a cozy logging community nestled in a mountain valley, turned into a hellish den of iniquity.  With a brisk running time of 85 minutes, there is no more fat on &quot;Walking Tall&quot; than there is on the Rock himself, a hulking yet curiously ingratiating presence who seems the most likely candidate to replace Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as America's favorite living comic book character. — Dave Kehr"

The soggy contemporary fairy tale is a cinematic cream puff with a melted marshmallow inside it. As the temperature rises, the whole gooey thing starts to melt. Julia Stiles's heroine is a model of integrity and decency who seems anachronistic in the age of Britney and Christina, especially when she has to choose between marrying the love of her life and becoming the Queen of Denmark and going to medical school.

DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic — a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk — King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel &quot;Alone.&quot; Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins — a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility.

The film's idea of Kelly as an unwitting social revolutionary — somewhere between Pretty Boy Floyd and Spartacus — is interesting, but the story, in spite of its brutality, never really gathers force. The picture's rhythms are too choppy to achieve the grandeur of epic, and the performances (with the exception of Orlando Bloom as Kelly's sidekick) are lifeless and unmemorable. Naomi Watts adds a touch of golden movie-star glamour in the underwritten role of Kelly's aristocratic love interest, a part she may well have taken out of a sense of patriotic duty. — A. O. Scott"

At the peak of his influence as a nightclub impresario and disc jockey, Mr.  Bingenheimer, a quiet, wizened gnome of indeterminate age with a pageboy haircut, was  a gatekeeper to the rock royalty. The movie is crammed with vintage photos and film  clips of Mr. Bingenheimer escorting beautiful girls and celebrities into his so-called  English disco, the tiny Los Angeles club he established during the heyday of British  glam-rock. Hollywood is well stocked with oddballs like Mr. Bingenheimer who glean  their self-worth from access to celebrity.

Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell"

There is the usual unsurprising surprise twist, the scene where the  killer says to the profiler &quot;we're the same&quot; and a succession of gruesome   crime-scene images. The film, competently directed by D. J.  Caruso, does have   one small claim to distinctiveness: it is one of the rare recent movies   shot in Canada that is actually set there, rather than in someplace like   New York or Chicago.

Still, this is the first studio picture to exhibit the tacky Troma influence, which means something, like the end of shame in Western civilization, perhaps. The first undead we see in this &quot;reimagining&quot; of the George Romero classic is a little girl with part of her face rotted away, who goes right for her dad's neck. The mother, Ana (Sarah Polley), barely escapes the house intact, and drives away. She runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a uniformed cop. They make their way to the Crossroad Mall, where a handful of security guards have taken up residence. They're determined to keep the zombies out, especially once Ana figures out that the life-free scourge is spread from a zombie bite. A scene in which weapons have to be liberated from a gun store, so the group can get to a marina and sail away to safety — don't ask —  shows why zombie pictures aren't unsettling anymore. The flesh-eaters are picked off like video-game targets. The eventual video game is bound to a lot more fun —  and less slowed down by bad dialogue —  than this &quot;Dead.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

A suspense thriller whose only suspense, and thrills, comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time, &quot;Secret Window&quot; dramatizes Mort's plight. He's suffering from writer's block, triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Maria Bello), and the protracted divorce proceedings. Mort lives in a remote cabin until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived-in as his bathrobe. The visitor is John Shooter (John Turturro), who drawls menacingly, &quot;You stole my book.&quot; Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved into his life.  Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel. Unfortunately, such a concern may not mean a whole lot to most viewers. Then again, neither will the whole of &quot;Secret Window,&quot; which has the vague plotting generally found in an anthology horror-show episode. — Elvis Mitchell"

His tightly coiled plot and swift, economical direction shows up the bloat and incoherence that afflict most Hollywood suspense pictures these days, and the many little touches of Mametude — jagged one-liners, swaggering repartee, William H. Macy — make it unusually flavorful. Val Kilmer, his sorrowful cool nicely suited to the fiercely stylized acting Mr. Mamet requires, plays a secret agent who must rescue the kidnapped daughter of a prominent politician. The plot's twists and turns ultimately lead nowhere very interesting, but for much of its running time the picture hums along beautifully, fueled by a potent mix of technical assurance and professional braggadocio. — A.

Otherwise, things are pretty much the same, as the screenwriters Don Rhymer, Harald Zwart and Dylan Sellers do their best to duplicate the first film's blend of James Bondish adventure and adolescent anxieties. Young Cody is assigned by the director of the C.I.A. (Keith David) to track down the rogue agent Diaz (Keith Allen), who was once Cody's trainer at C.I.A. camp but has now joined the evil English aristocrat Lord Kenworth (James Faulkner) in a mad plot to rule the world by implanting mind-controlling microchips in the molars of world leaders.  Directed by the British filmmaker Kevin Allen (&quot;Twin Town,&quot; &quot;The Big Tease&quot;), &quot;Cody Banks 2&quot; is full of chase sequences and comic battles, but Mr. Allen's work is compromised by an apparent inability to match his shots in a spatially coherent fashion.

Somewhere on the multi-channel soundtrack, the voice of the actor Kiefer Sutherland can be heard reciting facts and figures about the Nascar phenomenon, but he's effectively drowned out by the roar of the engines and the visceral impact of the 3-D images. What &quot;Nascar&quot; is really about, of course, is huge objects hurtling toward the camera &#151; which is to say, right at your head.  Mr. Wincer and his cinematographer, James Neihouse, come up with enough imaginative angles to keep the monotonous spectacle (how much fun is it really to watch cars drive in a circle?) fresh and exciting, and they even score the ultimate money shot &#151; a crash that sends a loose tire sailing straight into the viewer's forehead. &#151; Dave Kehr"

All went well for three days, until Mr. Simpson fell and drove his lower leg into his kneecap, leaving him crippled.  Mr. Yates tried to lower Mr. Simpson down the mountainside with a climbing rope, but accidentally lowered him into a deep crevasse.  Receiving no response from his partner, Mr. Yates was faced with a terrible choice:  either to stay and hold on to the rope, at the risk of being eventually pulled into the ravine by Mr. Simpson's body weight, or to cut the rope and attempt to save himself. This is compelling stuff, but there is something deeply distracting in the use of recreated material.  Mr. Macdonald, the director, imitates a raw, video-based cinema-verite style, but fairly often places the camera in locations that would be inaccessible to a cameraman on the actual expedition (for example, when Mr. Simpson falls into the crevasse, the camera crew is already there to meet him. — Dave Kehr"

The original series featured a pair of apparently plainclothes cops — who were they supposed to be fooling? — played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Mr. Phillips may not quite be a filmmaker, but he's on his way to becoming a director; his grasp of tone is a few steps ahead of his previous film, &quot;Old School.&quot; Starsky (Ben Stiller) is probably one of those rare detectives who don't deserve the by-the-book speeches from their commanders. He is paired with another loner — cool, shaggy Hutch (Owen Wilson) — who's a step away from being bounced from the force. Starsky and Hutch are tethered to a harness of buddy-movie clichés, but their congeniality comes from the actors' chemistry, demonstrated in five previous films. 
Eschewing the confrontational machismo of the television series, the movie instead plays Starsky's zealous obliviousness against Hutch's low-rent worldliness. But the movie's advertising tagline, &quot;Starsky & Hutch — they're the Man,&quot; needs to be amended. The movie belongs, completely and utterly, to Snoop Dogg.

The prize is $100,000. But the real star of  &quot;Hidalgo&quot; is a handsome mustang with a white face and brown patches over each eye who gets more glamorous close-ups than Joan Crawford did in her entire career.  Eventually, Frank and Hidalgo's journey is a testament to Frank's need for validation, and is so full of incident that the movie is finally about as colorful, and convincing, as one of those penny dreadfuls about Buffalo Bill's own life. — Elvis Mitchell"

Rémy (Rémy Girard) is dying of cancer, and friends, former lovers and his estranged wife gather around his death bed for a long, sentimental seminar replete with naughty jokes and wistful nostalgia. Joining them are two members of the younger generation, Rémy's son, Sébastien (Stéphane Rousseau), a wealthy international banker, and Nathalie (Marie-Josée Crozee), a heroin addict, who lack both the bravado and the narcissism of their parents.

A proudly bohemian resident of Greenwich Village, Ms. Lohan's Lola is uprooted from Manhattan and transplanted to a prosperous suburb in New Jersey, when her potter mom (the enduring Glenne Headly) decides she's had enough of the big city.  Used to being the center of attention, with her swirling outfits, honey blond hair and flair for self-dramatization (she dreams of becoming an actress), Lola is astonished to find herself the odd girl out at her new school, dominated by uptight preppies led by the imperious Carla (Megan Fox).  &quot;Confessions&quot; was directed by the British filmmaker Sara Sugarman (&quot;Very Annie Mary&quot;), which may explain why its New Jersey looks more like Beverly Hills than North Caldwell, and seems to function on a similar cultural basis, grounded in conspicuous consumption and the pursuit of celebrity (of course, it's also the kind of New Jersey you reach by taking a train from Grand Central). &#151; Dave Kehr"

The movie's willingness to embarrass every single participant is almost touching. The primary victim of the movie is Scotty ((Scott Mechlowicz). At his high school graduation, he's dumped by a girl who looks as if she just stepped off the set of &quot;Smallville.&quot; Worse, the e-mail correspondence that Scotty has had with his German friend Mieke takes a very weird turn; based on his extremely limited conversational German, Scotty figures out that Mieke has just come on to him. Horrified, he blows Mieke off forever — until his younger brother tells him that Mieke is a girl's name (Scotty thinks it's the German version of Mike), and, as it follows, Mieke (Jessica Boehrs) is indeed a girl. And, yes, kids, she is hot.  Since his friends, the twins Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Jamie (Travis Webster), are headed to Europe for a summer trip, Scotty joins them so he can chase down Mieke and straighten things out. Scotty's best friend, Cooper (Jacob Pitts), tags along, in search of the kind of rampant sexual activity that he imagines is only found in more sophisticated countries. — Elvis Mitchell"

Starting out as an underappreciated executive assistant (whose boss runs the Cleveland Coliseum), Jackie storms the all-male world of professional boxing with a rough, hard-punching middleweight named Luther Shaw (Omar Epps). The script is pretty much one cliché after another, and Charles S. Dutton's direction, in both the dramatic scenes and the fight sequences, is workmanlike, but some interesting and complex issues of race, ambition and masculinity hover over the cheery, inspirational story like a cloud of cigar smoke.

His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The trio —  an American exchange student (Michael Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) — spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinémathèque Française, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audiences love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace. Even if the sight of naked bodies leaves you cold, some of the director's camera movements can make you gasp with delight. — A. O. Scott"

But then Drew Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat, and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easy-going, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. The film's conceit — Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before — is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; While &quot;50 First Dates,&quot; deftly directed by Peter Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully. — A.

Although that imagination has evidently been fed by sources as various as Betty Boop, Jacques Tati and European comic books, its products are too strange to be assimilated into any known tradition. The plot is too bizarre for summary, but it involves the efforts of a diminutive, club-footed grandmother to rescue her grandson, a Tour de France cyclist, from the clutches of the French mafia. Aiding her are her faithful dog, Bruno, and the Triplets of the title, a trio of weird sisters who subsist on a diet of frogs and who make entrancing music with kitchen appliances and old newspapers. The Triplets is a similar collage of the found and the invented. Its style evokes a post-war France making its stubborn, eccentric way into the modern world — a nation of cigarette-rolling truck drivers and accordion-squeezing pop singers. It is surely the oddest movie of the year — by turns sweet and sinister, insouciant and grotesque, invitingly funny and forbiddingly dark.

Disney, the studio that brought us &quot;The Rookie&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (the movie and the team/merchandising operation), has no such restraint. Accordingly, &quot;Miracle&quot; does a yeoman's job of recycling the day-old dough that passes for its story.

Maddy's mother, Molly (Jennifer Beals), is a security expert who has just designed a fiendishly complicated vault for a greedy, cold-hearted banker (Michael Des Barres).

This film seems to be &quot;All About the Benjamins,&quot; to use the title of an Ice Cube action comedy. Most of the decisions involving this sequel to the spirited original &quot;Barbershop&quot; — a movie that itself cobbled together pieces of other projects — are about carefully retracing the steps of that 2002 hit in order to keep those $100 Benjamins flowing. But although Ice Cube's business sense is right on the money, the minor surprises of the first film are gone.  Ice Cube returns as star and executive producer of &quot;Barbershop 2.&quot; His Calvin Palmer provides the common sense that holds the shop together, a glue it desperately needs. When the moneyed inner-city entrepreneur Quentin Leroux (Harry Lennix) builds a lavish competitor called Nappy Cutz right across the street from Calvin's shop, the battle is on — Calvin has to fight to keep his business alive.

But instead, thanks to Jim  Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, &quot;In America&quot; is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers. The film, which Mr. Sheridan wrote with two of his daughters, is unabashedly personal, but he is too modest a filmmaker to turn his own experience into a lesson or a parable. From moment to moment, as it follows Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton, both quietly terrific) through their daily struggles, the story feels small, almost anecdotal. But just as its tactful realism is adorned with a dusting of magic, its unassuming clarity hides an unexpected grandeur. It is the kind of movie that keeps growing in your mind long after you ve seen it, and its characters are so radiantly particular that they come, after a while, to seem like people you know. — A. O.

The movie, which jumps back and forth between Havana and New York and offers a musical mosaic of Afro-Cuban styles, mostly salsa based, could be described as a basic course: Afro-Cuban music 101. Besides the director, the most articulate of several commentators is the jazz pianist, composer and educator Billy Taylor, who has been a long-time champion of Afro-Cuban music. The movie's  cheerful view of contemporary Havana is markedly different from Wim Wenders' elegiac  &quot;Buena Vista Social Club.&quot; &#151; Stephen Holden"

This flat romantic comedy by one of the writers of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;Zoolander,&quot; both of which starred Mr. Stiller, also fails to provide any reason a spunky girl-next-door like Ms. Aniston's character would give Mr. Stiller's uptight nerd the time of day.

The motorcycle-riding morons circle one another, hissing threats and flaring their nostrils as if they were about to lash their wrists together and break into a dance number reminiscent of Michael Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot; video. They also do a lot of flexing and flashing of their tattoos — which look like wall appliqués for a particularly surly 6-year-old's bedroom — and seem to spend more time primping than Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie. Chief among these idiots is Ford (Martin Henderson), who's just returned from either a restful vacation in Thailand, or a flight there from his enemies. But he can't just ride around greater downtown Barstow on his bike or tune-up his misfiring relationship with his ex-girl Shane (Monet Mazur), a bike shop owner he abandoned. He's being stalked by the menacing motorcycle gang leader Henry  (Matt Schulze), who runs a lucrative crystal Meth business. Ford has possession of some of Henry's drugs and he wants his valuable stash returned, or else. Henry has worked the competing gang leader Trey's bandanna into a knot; he tried to persuade Trey (Ice Cube) into joining the drug business, but he refused. Henry kills Trey's little brother and frames Ford for the crime. Now, in addition to Henry's boys, the police and Trey's squad also are out to put their hands on Ford, who has to slip past all of them to get to Los Angeles. Why? So the film can show its true colors as a tribute to Walter Hill's haiku of a gang action classic, &quot;The Warriors,&quot; a movie that has less dialogue and far more wit than &quot;Torque.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

His own luck begins to change when a cocktail waitress named Natalie (Maria  Bello) takes him to bed, and then falls in love with him in spite of herself. The setting- -Las Vegas with its sleazy, lowlife glamour- -feels a bit tired, and the story is hokey, but Wayne Kramer, making his feature debut as a director, reins in his gimmicky instincts enough to allow the skill of the actors to shine through the drab indie-noir conventions.

It's the aftermath. The actors playing the characters who have been rocked by catastrophe don't sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they're linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon. This is American Existentialism. The stars achieve something that doesn't sound as if it's possible: a virtuosity in the depiction of people wasting away minute by minute. Be prepared for it. You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the director plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that &quot;21 Grams&quot; is tantamount to the discovery of a new country. Prof. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is suffering from a damaged heart, which is about to give out on him, and the transplant he receives so consumes him with guilt that he's like a death-row prisoner with a horrible secret who's been pardoned. He still believes he deserves to die. Cristina (Naomi Watts), a reformed party girl, has returned to her fallen ways after taking up with Paul. She's lost her family in an auto accident. And Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a shaggy, trembling mountain of anger he can barely contain. His already tenuous grasp on sobriety is slipping away even faster since being involved in a terrible incident. Working with the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and the bewilderingly versatile cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto — the team he assembled for his debut feature, &quot;Amores Perros&quot; — Mr. González Iñárritu once again deals with three scenarios connected by one far-reaching cataclysm. It's too early to call it a crowning work of a career — this is only his second film — but it may well be the crowning work of this year. — Elvis Mitchell"

Cathy's attempt to get back the house and Behrani's intransigent refusal to let go of it escalate toward a heavily foreshadowed catastrophe. The movie, adapted from a novel by Andre Dubus III, is the nearly flawed execution of a deeply flawed premise. The logic of the story seems to override the plausible motives of the characters, and you may feel the overwhelming force of the tragic ending without quite believing it. Ms. Connelly is a bit blank, her intelligence trapped by Cathy's passivity, but Mr. Kingsley, playing a patriarch in crisis, is superb. So are Ron Eldard, as the sheriff s deputy whose attempts to help Cathy accelerate the inevitable disaster, and especially Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Behrani's weary, good-hearted wife. Vadim Perelman, directing his first feature film, shows himself to be a filmmaker of impressive tact and restraint.

Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Billy Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death. There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, in consequence, lacks one, as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes, featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses, and a town where nobody wears shoes. Tim Burton's imagination, so wild and marvelous in movies like &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; seems to have been tamed. Rather than resonating with the uncanny magic of the unconscious, his images seem to be part of a strategy of denial, designed to obscure the possibility that Edward, a charismatic raconteur, might also be a narcissist and a compulsive liar. Will might forgive these lapses — that is a son's prerogative, after all. Far worse, from the audience's point of view, is that Edward is also a bit of a bore. — A. O. Scott"

Chris (Helen Mirren) and Annie (Julie Walters) are middle-aged members of the Knapely chapter of the Women's Institute, an organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of &quot;fun and friendship.&quot; Chris, spotting a girlie calendar at her auto mechanic's garage, is inspired with the notion of posing nude for a calendar to raise money for charity. She finds a surprisingly large number of middle-aged to elderly recruits at the Institute. Ms. Mirren and Ms. Walters are a sunny, amusing couple, even when there's tension between them because Chris has so immersed herself in her new project that she's ignoring her son and  husband. The most likable aspect of the film is the husbands left on the sidelines, and the team behind &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is savvy enough not to overplay that role reversal.

J. Hogan's adaptation of J. M. Barrie's novel is bracingly true to the tough, buoyant spirit of the original, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. While Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) is appropriately dashing and adventurous, Hook (Jason Isaacs) wonderfully villainous and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys, and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display both Wendy's child-like eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that Peter Pan, beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. The sets and special effects are rousing and vivid, but what distinguishes this Peter Pan from the other versions (and from most recent children s entertainment) is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up. — A.

The story of a big, mostly happy family that includes 12 mostly adorable children and two mostly adoring parents whose 23-year marriage still has a snap of sex is set in suburban Illinois.  But its real location is that imaginary playground of cheery roughhouse and sanitized mischief known as Sitcomland, where it is now and forever 1955.  For Steve Martin, who has earned his crown as the movies' most affably, reassuring 50's-style dad since Spencer  Tracy, the role of the paterfamilias who coaches college football is just not a piece of  cake but a morsel of buttery fudge that instantly melts on his tongue. — Stephen Holden"

Since then, Dick's posthumous legacy has suffered through movies like &quot;Impostor,&quot; and Mr. Woo made &quot;Windtalkers.&quot;  But their new meeting of temperaments is surprisingly adept, given that it's basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could possibly expect from such a collaboration, especially when Ben Affleck — an actor whose becalmed exterior reflects an inability to project an inner life — is added to the mix.  He plays Michael Jennings, a hotshot inventor who steals the ideas and properties of other corporations, and refines them for competitors. For legal reasons, Michael gets his mind wiped clean of the theft by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work — all for a paycheck.  When a new, less dangerous procedure comes along — one that can safely do away with three years, instead of a few months — Michael is invited by an old friend to get involved in a project that could potentially change the world, and net Michael an eight-figure income. He will come out three years later with a larger bank balance and no idea of his accomplishments. It's here that the sleek, ascetic paranoia  that Dick triggered in his short story &quot;Paycheck&quot; surfaces: the invasion of the mind and soul. — Elvis Mitchell

This latest holiday literary adaptation from Miramax has the usual trappings of prestige — an award-winning novel as its source, a parade of top-notch filmmaking and acting talent — but it also has touches of intelligence and humor that separate it from such lifeless offerings as &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;The Cider House Rules.&quot; Nicole Kidman, playing an over-civilized preacher's daughter stranded on a North Carolina farm during the Civil War, has never been lovelier. Her unfiltered movie-star charisma makes the character both irresistible and a little unbelievable. Jude Law is her long-lost lover, a Confederate soldier trudging homeward and meeting up with a procession of Hollywood hillbillies along the way. Anthony Minghella's dour seriousness is mitigated by his evident love of pageantry and spectacle, and the movie, in the best old Hollywood tradition, adds up to a mountain of honest corn. It's far from a great movie, but it has enough great-movie touches — lovely scenery, a richly layered soundtrack, a handful of diverting secondary performances (notably Renée Zellwegger, as Ruby, Ms. Kidman's no-nonsense backwoods helpmeet, and Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's wayward, fiddle-playing father), a pair of attractive stars — to make you wish it were one. — A.

Julia Roberts, miscast but charming nonetheless, is a free-spirited Californian who moves East to teach art history at demure, snooty Wellesley College in 1953 and shakes up the place enough to be deemed subversive. Appalled to discover that her brilliant, privileged students have no post-graduate ambitions beyond marrying and settling down, she preaches emancipation.

But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back.

After Harry suffers a heart attack in Erica's East Hampton beach house, she becomes his reluctant nurse, attracting the amorous attention of his doctor (Keanu Reeves). The film, a wry, knowing celebration of middle-age sexuality, is so funny in large part because it acknowledges the inevitability of hurt feelings.

Bob and Walt are conjoined country mouse and city mouse; the directors bring the double-sided motif closer together than ever before. Bob is happy slinging burgers, while Walt aspires to be an actor —  a successful one, that is. He's already the star of their hometown, where he has the lead in the one-man Truman Capote show &quot;Tru&quot;; some of the funniest stuff in &quot;Stuck on You&quot; involves the comparison of Robert Morse's version to Walt's.

His movie falls squarely into the realm of the previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot; And I do mean squarely.  &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in Japanese culture: John Ford's &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; And this time, the can-do idol of millions, Tom Cruise, uses his polished chrome smile mirthlessly. The uneven &quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that's far more effective at communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more intimate ones. Mr. Cruise plays the burnt-out former Army officer and Indian fighter Nathan Algren. He is hired by his former commander (Tony Goldwyn) who wants Algren to travel to Tokyo and train Japanese soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles.  Algren is forced to send his nervous, underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against an enemy of the Emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second-in-command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more bewildering, cared for by Katusmoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren killed. Algren then learns the ways of the samurai with an alacrity that's expected of movie stars. — Elvis Mitchell"

That her dreams come true will come as no surprise; nor will the rather mild obstacles she faces. The story is crowded with incidents and subplots, but Ms. Alba's bland, self-confident perkiness keeps real emotional trouble at bay. Corny as it is, the movie is also a winning and warm-hearted celebration of upward mobility and civic responsibility, and the power of hip-hop to combine them. Mekhi Phifer plays Honey's love interest and neighborhood ally, and Lil' Romeo, showing real promise as an actor, plays a talented break-dancer whom Honey must save from the local drug dealer. The cameos by real-life rappers like Ginuwine and Missy Elliott, and the buoyant, beat-heavy soundtrack, give the movie an extra hit of vitality and glamour. — A. O. Scott"

Tom McCarthy has such an appreciation for quiet that it occupies the same space as a character in this film, a delicate, thoughtful and often hilarious take on loneliness.  Fin, with his low, rational voice and intense stare, has moved into the small spot after he inherits it. Mr. McCarthy treats Fin's new life as if his protagonist were emerging from underwater and must adjust to the onrush of aural assault. Much of it comes from Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the relentlessly friendly and talky Cuban who pulls up every day in his food truck to run what must be the loneliest retail location not staffed by a Maytag salesman. Hawking coffee and fanning up a cloud of busy, pushy and likable chatter, Joe elbows his way into the taciturn Fin's life. Mr. McCarthy wrings contrasts from the serene, diminutive Mr. Dinklage — whose dignity seems unassailable until finally ruffled, when he lets loose a thunderbolt of hostility — and the big, buffed Cannavale, whose unremitting volubility is sheer charm. Their relationship is goofily enthralling. A movie about a dwarf certainly flirts with being cringe-worthy, at least in the abstract, but Mr. McCarthy deals with his creations as characters. What's most important about Fin is the detachment he imposes on himself — his resignation with loneliness. — Elvis Mitchell"

The film isfar more a celebration of the Hubleyss work (and marriage) than a critical examination of it, stringing together interviews with the Hubleys culled from various archival sources and extensive clips from their films, including the Oscar-winning Moonbird of 1959.  With testimony from animation historians Charles Solomon and John Canemaker, the case is made that the Hubleys were among the first to liberate animation from pigs and bunnies, as John characterized the subject matter of studio cartoons, and introduce weighty themes such as overpopulation and the nuclear menace.  Though not a technically polished production, Independent Spirits stands as an effective and affectionate introduction to a pair of sympathetic and dedicated artists. — Dave Kehr"

The light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. &quot;Bad Santa&quot; takes all of the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who's annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour, they've ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot; and the his fiction-film debut &quot;Ghost World,&quot; both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. &quot;Santa&quot; falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot.  Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton, it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage offal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy. —  Elvis Mitchell"

Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that 40 years after John Ford's 1956 &quot;The Searchers,&quot; we've arrived at a point in film history in which the movie industry can only offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd). Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for — she's kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians who plan to sell her once they cross the border into Mexico. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) returns home: there's already tension in the household. When the worst happens, Maggie is forced to team with her father to track down her daughter. But &quot;The Missing&quot; leaves out the sexual paranoia that John Wayne's face reflected; he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become sexually involved with her captors. Despite torrents of brutality, there's no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in &quot;The Missing.&quot; As a result, this is a movie that only exists from the shoulders up. It's an intriguing way for Ron Howard to play to his chief strength — and interests — the knotty and peculiar emotional cross-currents that buffet a family. And  for a time, before it shifts into the thriller aspect of the story, &quot;The Missing&quot; feels like a thoughtful attempt to focus on the strains of home life.   After the mission of &quot;The Missing&quot; begins, however, the movie starts to feel like an episode of Stephen King's &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

The price of the popcorn-and drink combo at most theaters running this film is scarier. The titular entity is occupied by a ghost, Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), who took his own life centuries ago in response to his lady love's suicide. Years later, the realtor Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy) is summoned to Gracey Manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and son, Michael (Marc John Jeffries). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor. &quot;Mansion&quot; is a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction - it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a film like &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; could dredge up.

Instead, Billy Ray relates Glass's downfall with minimal embellishment and turns a tawdry anecdote into a sober, curiously thrilling examination of moral recklessness and office intrigue. What starts out as a sharp workplace comedy gradually darkens into a kind of managerial film noir as Glass (played with a perfect mixture of creepiness and charm by Hayden Christensen) is pursued by Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), the magazine's editor and, in this version at least, the savior of its honor. With considerable ingenuity and wit, the movie's center of gravity shifts from Glass to Lane, and its ideas — about workplace loyalty, journalistic ethics, and the line between ambition and pathology — are all the more forceful for being delivered in a whisper. — A.

For a while, this glib thriller, directed with reasonable skill by Mathieu Kassovitz, will manage to quicken your pulse and keep you in a state of nervous anticipation. In the end, though, as the ghost-story clichés collide with the serial killer clichés and the women-behind-bars clichés give way to the wronged-women-seeking-revenge clichés, the movie proves to be both too much and not enough — yet another slick, empty package of ersatz entertainment, at once overwrought and under-thought. — A.

Mr. Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a British frigate doing battle with a mysterious French battle ship off the Coast of South America. The combat scenes are shot with economy and vigor, but the most thrilling parts of the movie take place between skirmishes, when the complex system of authority and deference that runs the Surprise —  and the personality traits needed to keep it running —  is at the center of attention. The film's theme is the nature of authority, and Aubrey functions as a kind of ideal CEO: charismatic, tactically astute and able to instill in his sailors a sense of discipline and respect. Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, Aubrey's best friend and foil, and the tension between them — between reason and duty, between intellect and action — gives the movie some unexpected dramatic depth. — A.

The animated characters Daffy  Duck and Bugs Bunny interact with Drendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman, as Warner Bros. employees. At every turn, you can sense the filmmakers' jitters as they pack more and  more extraneous stuff into each scene. The absurd spy plot, which borrows heavily from  the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, is half-smothered under the tonnage of pop-culture  references. And the movie, which sustains the sheer dizzying speed of a Saturday-morning  cartoon for 90 minutes, is exhausting to watch.  But when this mad dash of a comedy  pauses to catch its breath, it has a moment or two of pure cinematic wonder.

The title comes from the British director Alan Clarke's 1989 rough-and-ready short film of the same name, a tough and dense look at the   violence in northern Ireland, which also didn't paste answers onto the  problem. Mr. Clarke's short outraged or absorbed viewers in the way Mr. Van  Sant's movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is likely to do. (Mr. Clarke's title referred to the aphorism about the elephant in the living room — a problem that people refuse to face for so long that they are no longer even able to  see it.) &quot;Elephant&quot; will confound audiences looking for solutions or villains, because it doesn't supply them. There's no narrator perched  omnisciently over the events, nor the kinds of exaggerated melodramatics  and pop music that teen movies employ to insistently nag at emotions. There are few recognizable actors, since Mr. Van Sant populated the movie with   kids who had never acted before, heightening the realism and the tension. Mr. Van Sant gives &quot;Elephant&quot; a Spartan yet elusive life by shifting the film's focus from one group of  students to another; the camera actually drifts like a bored high school student.  And by the end of the movie, we realize where much of the power and clarity of the film comes  from. By making the camera an observer, we get a perspective  that often comes out of horror movies, a choice that whips the ordinary  with the terrifying —  an unforgettable mix. — Elvis Mitchell"

When Kahn collapsed and died of a heart attack in the men's room at Pennsylvania Station, he had been deemed by some to be the greatest living American architect, but his body remained unidentified for two days. At his death he was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Nathaniel Kahn was 11 at the time, and the personal documentary he has made, &quot;My Architect,&quot; is a record of his quest to put together the pieces of his father's compartmentalized life.

Buddy, who towers over the other residents of the North Pole (thanks to some ingeniously designed sets and clever camera angles), is lovable but inept; he has been accepted by the elves, and his adoptive father (Bob Newhart) dotes on him, but he still does not quite fit in. And so, following the timeworn adoptee-in-search-of-birth-parent storyline, Buddy sets out for New York, on a mission to find his roots and also to revive the faltering Christmas spirit of the notoriously cynical locals, who include his dad (James Caan) and an adorable department store pseudo-elf (Zooey Deschanel). Directed in relatively mellow, easy-going style by Jon Favreau, &quot;Elf&quot; is a charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it. The restraint comes from the casting of two beloved old sitcom curmudgeons, Ed Asner and Mr. Newhart, as Santa and his chief Elf. The responsibility for overdoing it belongs to Mr. Ferrell, who seems poised to enter the million-dollar pop-culture doofus pantheon alongside Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey and Spongebob Squarepants. — A.

The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom. It is not altogether worthless: the Wachowski Brothers still know how to stage an action sequence, and there are some scenes that have a quiet, mysterious beauty. If they would only let go of their grandiose theological pretensions, they might once again be interesting filmmakers. — A. O. Scott"

Cobbling together ancient cross-cultural myths of initiation and human beings who turn into animals, it  tells the story of Kenai (the voice of Joaquin Phoenix), a hot-headed Indian boy on the verge of  manhood who is transformed into a bear so he can learn compassion for all creatures  great and small.

Mr. Busch's character, Angela Arden, is a semi-retired pop singer, once known as &quot;America's Nightingale,&quot; who suggests a hybrid of Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Fontaine. The absurdist  movie, which is all plot and no plot at the same time, is a broad spoof of so-called  women's pictures from the 1940's through the 60's.

The problem is that the source, Philip Roth's 2000 novel, is not especially sober or scrupulous: it is an angry, ungainly squall of a book, a clamorous defense of sexual vitality in an age of Puritan censoriousness and a lyrical inquiry into the mysteries of race, old age and recent American history. As Coleman Silk, a Classics professor chased from his job after being absurdly accused of racism, Anthony Hopkins has a loose, mellow exuberance that almost persuades you to overlook a basic, insurmountable improbability, namely that his character is a black man who has spent most of his adulthood passing for white. Nicole Kidman, playing Coleman's abused, impoverished and much younger lover, is almost as hard to believe, but her performance is nonetheless serious and unaffected. Some of the best work comes in smaller parts: Wentworth Miller as young Coleman; Anna Deavere Smith as his mother; and especially Jacinda Barrett as the great love of his youth. The movie has many memorable, moving scenes — as well as a few awkward and embarrassing ones — but it never coheres either dramatically or intellectually, largely because it lacks a way to approximate the novel's unifying force, which is Mr. Roth s unruly, passionate and brilliant voice. — A.

The camera, as it surveys the grimy streets and cramped apartments of lower Manhattan, trembles as if it were running a fever, and Dion Beebe's cinematography is jumpy and bleary-eyed. Meg Ryan, who has darkened her hair and suppressed all of her characteristic perkiness, plays Frannie, a writing teacher whose feverish love affair with a homicide detective (Mark Ruffalo) involves her in the search for a serial killer. The movie's association of female sexuality with mortal risk is potentially interesting, but the cooked-up, conventional serial killer plot smothers its suggestive nuances and makes the psychology of the two main characters, which might have been provocatively mysterious, seem as deliberately smudged as the film's visual style. — A.

Christine Jeff's film is relatively even-handed in its treatment of Hughes (Daniel Craig) and turns its subject from a case study in literary pathology into the heroine of a modern literary opera. The film, shot in dark, over-saturated colors by John Toon, is itself oversaturated with feeling. Rather than try to explain Plath s death, or probe the roots of her poetry, Ms. Jeffs and Gwenyth Paltrow burrow deep into her personality, leaving its essential, unsettling mysteries intact. Ms. Paltrow is a vivid, passionate presence throughout the film — she is rarely off the screen — and she charts the jagged course of Plath's abbreviated adulthood with ardor and intelligence. The movie turns biography into melodrama, but it does so out of a fierce, fascinated loyalty to Plath, who after all did much the same thing in her best poems. — A. O. Scott"

Most of the spoofing is at the expense of movies like  &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;The Ring&quot; and the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; movies. The funniest sequence in a comedy that revels in knockabout farce and has the attention span of a hyperactive child  is a strenuous group effort to revive a corpse, first through some alarmingly aggressive  artificial respiration, then through slapping and slamming the body until it breaks apart.

No amount of misguided effort is going to help. It's an easy picture to ridicule; after a while, you almost feel as if the stars are making fun of the movie. Or at least, you'll wish Angelina Jolie — with her radiant presence and Panavision lips — and Clive Owen, with his brisk, existentialist cool were smart enough to do so. After the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; movies, with their globe-trotting superficiality and numbing imbecility, Ms. Jolie must feel she owes her fans something serious. Unfortunately, she's starring in a movie even more benumbed and superficial, a liberal video game that demeans the very refugees it tries to spotlight. Her good-heartedness is probably the reason she chose to star in this film about a shallow young woman, Sarah Jordan, who's shaken out of her insular existence by the dashing Dr. Nick Callahan (Mr. Owen). &quot;Borders&quot; wants to dramatize the chasm between Sarah and Nick, whose impatient compassion endangers as many refugees as it saves. That metaphorical land mass is supposed to be her middle-class naiveté and his brooding, no-nonsense altruism. But they're much closer than they think — a pair of noble idiots. Inspired by his example, she raises money and follows him with medical supplies and food to Ethiopia. He repays her kindness with blithe cruelty. They finally tryst; the sweat beads seductively on their skins, while their glamorously gaunt jawlines expel plumes of cigarette smoke. This is a movie so oblivious that Martin Campbell, an accomplished action filmmaker, forgot that in the 1940's &quot;Casablanca&quot; had the good sense to have Rick note that the troubles of two people don't amount to a hill of beans. &quot;Borders&quot; is reminiscent of another 40's classic, the smashingly absurd &quot;Duel in the Sun,&quot; and is as realistic as a recent film based on real incidents: the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

The crime was notable for its brutality, and also because it appeared to implicate John Holmes, the legendary porn star who knew the victims. In reconstructing the crime, James Cox has made an aggressively stylish, blithely sleazy whodunit that might be described as &quot;Law and Order&quot; on crack. Val Kilmer, as Holmes, is antic, needy and occasionally charming, and the rest of the cast seems to enjoy the hyperactively scuzzy ambience of drugs, guns and classic rock. Lisa Kudrow, playing Holmes's estranged wife, Sharon, stands out from the rest. Her severity and restraint, and the opacity of her motives, make her the only interesting character in a movie that, while sometimes absorbing, ultimately feels pointless. — A. O. Scott"

The 10-day festival, which draws over 25,000 people annually to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, where they create and then disassemble a temporary city, is a kind of modern-day Woodstock festival with a new-age, survivalist, environmentally sensitive aesthetic.

It is, instead, a long march to the slaughterhouse that seems to take forever to get going and, once it does, goes nowhere that hasn't been visited before by more talented filmmakers.  The plot, such as it is, kicks in when a van full of early 70's hippies stumbles into the remote farmhouse owned by the Hooper clan — crazed rednecks who, in the original version, represented a nightmare vision of Richard Nixon's Middle America, but who here represent little other than stereotypes in the service of sadism.

Yet, something feels familiar about the picture — Mr. Hackman has played this grubby-souled, hand-tailored heart of modern corruption before, and in a previous Grisham adaptation: &quot;The Firm.&quot; This time, he's a slick jury consultant named Rankin Fitch who employs ruthless tactics to empanel a jury that will best service his client. And like &quot;The Firm,&quot; the schematic crassness of the narrative provides an actor the opportunity to deliver some fine work. John Cusack gives one of his wiliest performances in some time, and one of his most adult, as the aging slacker who is drafted into jury duty. Apparently, the writers realize there's not much to be done with the boilerplate narrative, which involves the machinations of  the jury that Fitch is laboring to bend to his own will. (Mr. Hoffman is the endearing plaintiff attorney.) You may end up wishing that the actors had found a less needlessly showoffy picture to practice their craft. Especially since half the time, they're filmed as if they were in the director's way. Gary Fleder tries to boldface his assets, though in doing so, he undermines the picture; he stages &quot;Jury&quot; as if it were an episode of &quot;CSI.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

According to the text that appears onscreen at the end of Joel Schumacher's biopic, her death incited public outrage and spurred the passage of new laws, which helped to ease the drug-trafficking and related criminality that had plagued Ireland for so long. Unfortunately, those end titles, and the ones at the beginning, are the most informative portions of the film, as well as the most powerful. What comes between them is a flat-footed, overwrought crusader-against-evil melodrama, in which Cate Blanchett's formidable gifts as an actress are reduced to a haircut and an accent. Her Veronica Guerin bravely mocks and harasses various thugs and lowlifes, and consoles her worried co-workers and family members, but the movie is devoid of both dramatic intensity and genuine emotion.

Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities.

This time the good work comes from George Clooney. His gift of gab is perfectly suited for Miles, the crème de la crème of divorce lawyers. Miles has everything but a soul, though he doesn't actually look as if he'd require one. And the babe he falls for isn't exactly the person to give him one either. Marilyn (Catherine  Zeta-Jones), as delectable as a white-chocolate Easter Bunny, has been tagged for a vicious divorce by her husband, a serial adulterer, after she catches him cheating. Her uptown-girl beauty and silken opacity make her the kind of trophy Miles would want to win. And when she jabs a No. 2 pencil into Miles's heart by showing up with her beau, a Texas millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles is horrified, but not defeated.

This may be the picture's most serious flaw, since it comes from a man whose worship of action movies from all over the world (but especially Asia) is evident in every frame. Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. — A.

The movie pits an elderly Elvis Presley and J.F.K., who's now an old African-American, against a mummy who shambles around a retirement home sucking the souls out of victims in a manner that probably explains why the picture got an R rating. The writer-director Don Corsarelli, faithfully working from a short story by Joe R. Lansdale, is moored in confines as limiting as the wheelchair the King uses to get around and a budget as starved of cash as Presley's movies were of imagination. The picture has a grungy high-spirit for its first third, and dissipates like a mist from an aerosol can by that point. When it requires that extra charge of magic or technique to lift it, the picture stalls out; finally, it's neither scary enough nor funny enough &#151; tramps like this, baby, they were born to be rented.  What fission the movie generates comes from its lead performers, including Ossie Davis's mocking, salted gravitas in playing J.F.K. &#151; here, he surgically went black and can't go back after the assassination attempt on his life.

Mr. Washington, as the small-town Florida police chief Matt Lee Whitlock, steals several hundred thousand dollars in seized drug money to pay for the experimental cancer therapy his mistress Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) needs. But when she and her jealous husband, Chris (Dean Cain), die in a fire —  and all the money mysteriously disappears, while Matt is left the beneficiary of Ann Merai's million-dollar insurance policy —  the clues point to Matt as the murderer. To make matters worse, Matt's estranged detective wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), is investigating the case. To further crank up Matt's adrenaline level as he's looking for evidence to clear himself, the feds want the drug money —  now. Mr. Washington plays the desperation well; it becomes Matt's defining characteristic. And Carl Franklin keeps &quot;Time&quot; breezy enough to fight the oppressive humidity that his cast is obviously laboring under in the Florida sun by keeping the proceedings buoyant. By the time Matt is fighting to hang onto a rapidly crumbling hotel balcony while battling a suspect, you realize that a functioning sense of humor is the classiest touch that a filmmaker could lend to the piled-on plot. — Elvis Mitchell"

The sexiness comes from the busy, desperate need-to-impress heat of a flirtation, an unrequited love communicated through a filter of sleep deprivation. &quot;Translation&quot; is also one of the purest and simplest examples ever of a director's falling in love with her star's gifts. And never has a director found a figure more deserving of her admiration than Bill Murray. He plays a vodka-and-bitters version of himself, and the persona that made him famous. His character, Bob, is an American movie star who's in Tokyo to participate in the celebrity not-so-secret shame: picking up a boatload of dough to appear in commercials for Suntory whiskey. While blinking sleeplessly around the hotel lobby of the majestically hermetic Tokyo Hyatt, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who has been abandoned by her husband, an ambitious photographer; he's off shooting a band. The movie follows the twists and connections in Bob and Charlotte's relationship; like some trans-Atlantic phone calls, their feelings reach each other on a five-second delay.

The story of self-discovery that Audrey Wells leads Frances, a writer, through is eminently superficial, though the director keeps the movie going with a steady, commanding hand. Ms. Lane initially gives Frances a calm and pleasant sunniness, though she is resigned to never finishing her book.  She's attending a book signing early in the movie when she learns of her husband's philandering. When her best friend gives Frances a ticket to Tuscany, she grabs it. The trip is supposed to be pressure-free for Frances — it's a gay tour of Italy. She finds a new love anyway: a villa, Bramasole, that she buys on the spur of the moment.  But Tuscany is not the soul-saver that Frances hopes for: the house's promises of romance and a new life in Italy don't burst into bloom like the sunflowers that are often in view. The lesson of &quot;Sun&quot; is that Frances needs to look closer at the big picture, and her avoidance of that raises questions about how perceptive a critic she must have been. Eventually, the movie feels Frances has suffered enough and slaps on a happy ending like a Post-it note, but it's not earned. — Elvis Mitchell"

The Rock plays Beck (no first name), a reluctant enforcer for a Los Angeles loan shark who is sent to the jungles of Brazil (though the film was shot in Hawaii) to retrieve his boss's son, Travis (Seann William Scott, of the &quot;American Pie&quot; series). But Travis isn't eager to return, having discovered the location of a valuable golden idol, cunningly concealed for centuries in a hidden, booby-trapped cave.  Hatcher (Christopher Walken), the cynical American who owns and operates a hellish open pit gold mine in the area, is also after Travis's secret, as is Mariana (Rosario Dawson), a local beauty who owns a bar but harbors a big secret of her own.

As the film veers uncertainly between meticulous historical recapitulation  and shameless hokiness, it brings in enough characters to populate a mini-series. When the  historical detail becomes too confusing, the movie shamelessly overcompensates by  wallowing in cheap sentimentality. Although Joseph Fiennes's performance captures  Luther's psychic and spiritual turbulence, the character never quite achieves a full human  dimension. — Stephen Holden"

As the film opens he has grown into a full-fledged gay man, though he is still living in the home of his parents, Maria (Ginette Reno) and Gino (Paul Sorvino). Angelo finally works up the courage to move out of his parents' home and into an apartment he shares with Nino (Peter Miller), a closeted Montreal cop. The problem for Angelo and Nino: how to keep their loving relationship a secret from their volatile parents, who are still eagerly fixing them up with &quot;nice Italian girls.&quot; Émile Gaudreault's direction is about as basic as you can get: his film consists almost entirely of close-ups, with a cut from one character to the next at the end of every line. The accents wobble from the Chico Marx delivery of Mr. Sorvino to the distinctly French-inflected line readings of some of the local actors.

The movie is pure hokum, but at least it spins out a yarn.

Kate Beckinsale stars as a vampire warrior, and Scott Speedman (formerly of &quot;Felicity&quot; on WB) plays a young human doctor who doesn't know nearly enough about his blood line. The film does have some visual style, sometimes a little too much. Otherwise it achieves only loudness, aggressive confusion and one of the silliest head-splittings in film history. You can't say that Danny McBride's script is laden with clichés. The dialogue (&quot;We have much to discuss&quot;; &quot;Mark my words.

While far from his best work, this slight, tart anti-romantic comedy has a loose, easy rhythm and an impressive number of funny lines and gags. Jason Biggs, who is perhaps a little too amiable for the job, plays the Woody Allen surrogate, a comedy writer named Jerry Falk who is saddled with a difficult manager (Danny  DeVito) and an impossible girlfriend, a would-be actress named Amanda (Christina Ricci). Amanda, a sexual dynamo and a manipulative head case, might have been an exercise in sour misogyny, but Ms. Ricci has a feral intelligence that turns her into a finely drawn comic monster. Mr. Allen himself appears as an older comedy writer who appoints himself Jerry's mentor. The character — paranoid, vengeful, bluntly anti-intellectual — is both the continuation of other Woody Allen characters and a rebuke to their needy, self-conscious, analytical approaches to life. — A.O.

The struggle between sacred and profane impulses is an old one in American popular music, and here it is given an interesting contemporary twist.

This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes — it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes —  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life.

The digital video cinematography has unusual depth and luster, the action sequences are punchy and inventive, and the music is pretty good, too. Unfortunately, it seems as if the writing and directing, which Robert Rodriguez also did, were something of an afterthought. There are some witty moments, mostly courtesy of Johnny Depp, who plays a C.I.A. agent messing around in Mexico, and some high-impact many-gun salutes to the action auteurs Sergio Leone and John Woo. But the mood of tongue-in-cheek, romantic mayhem is spoiled by the picture's incoherence, and by its resort to appalling extremes of violence when nothing else is working.

The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary — by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device — and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl —  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his. — Elvis Mitchell"

They are a forgotten population struggling to bring in enough income so that they don't become disposable. They're expendable manpower in the war to man the desks, mops and bottom-drawer duties of the behind-the-scenes world of luxury hotels, where they're unnoticed by the public, and underpaid and overworked by their employers. This is an urban-legend horror story rendered with grim intelligence by the man with the right tools for the job: Stephen Frears. This understated and sure film is set in a world of survivors. One of them, the Nigerian Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) — who drives a cab and also works as a hotel porter under the large thumb of the smooth operator night manager, Sneaky, a smooth operator (Sergi Lopez) — seems to be as haunted as he is obsessed. The film doesn't elaborate on the troubles that have sent Okwe so far from home; all we really know is that he has left a wife and a daughter behind, and part of his pain comes from pining for them. That lingering misery is what keeps him safely on the couch of his Turkish roommate, the virginal Senay (Audrey Tatou), refusing to act on the magnetism that keeps her gazing at him adoringly. He's capable of loyalty to the rest of his ad hoc family —  to Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), the mortuary attendant, and the dangerously close-to-cliché, lovable hooker (Sophie Okonedo). The actress's cleverness brings shading and warmth to an otherwise stereotyped part. &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; suggests a demented sequel to Paul Mazursky's &quot;Moscow on the Hudson,&quot; a dog-eared fairy tale in which industry and hard work could deliver refugees from evil, or at least into the middle classes.

The younger Mr. Brown was the co-writer and an associate producer on &quot;The Endless Summer II,&quot; a sequel released in 1994; with &quot;Step Into Liquid,&quot; he assumes the entire process, which includes writing, edited and delivering the casual, conversational narration that the senior Mr. Brown made a trademark of his films.

Isabel's character and motives remain irritatingly blank, even as she undergoes a wondrous transformation, acquiring a taste for fine lingerie, elegant coiffure and suave, middle-aged politicians. But the movie lets the accessories do too much of the work, and only Thierry Lhermitte (as Isabel's politician lover) and Glenn Close (as an expatriate writer) show any real comic esprit; it's a comedy made by filmmakers with little sense of timing and almost no sense of humor, with plenty of good taste and no real flavor. — A.O.

With his furtive voice and fluttering diction, Mr. Scott nearly always sounds as if he's slipping information under an embassy door; the lines waft angrily around his mouth before disappearing and leaving a whispery trace. Dave Hurst, the dentist he plays, works hard to keep his messy domestic life in order while slaving away at a dental practice with his wife, Dana (Hope Davis), while murmuring about the existence he doesn't get to lead. Mr. Rudolph weaves a hilarious subtext  — the spoiled baby-boomer who refuses to relinquish his time in the spotlight  — into a home-life scenario. This notion of nurturing his inner infant keeps things ticking. Dave is suspicious of Dana, and slightly irritated at the three great daughters that he and Dane have raised.

Much of its power comes from the delicate charisma of Keisha Castle-Hughes, making her acting debut as Pai.

The inmates, all female, are the victims of a stringently moralistic brand of Irish Catholicism, now on the wane, that used to punish unmarried young women (many in their teens) for premarital sex.  These &quot;bad girls&quot; exiled from their families and communities were forced to do slave labor in convent laundries that proliferated in Ireland until recently. &quot;The Magdalene Sisters,&quot; which tells the semifictionalized stories of four young women in one convent, is set roughly from 1964 to 1969.   Most prison movies have a monster authority figure, and so does this film. Here that ogre is the head nun, Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a twisted diabolical autocrat. In a brilliant performance, Ms. McEwan makes this character horribly believable by portraying her cruelty not as raw sadism but as righteous punishment dispensed by a religious fanatic with a warped sense of values. — Stephen Holden"

The movie, which pits Freddy Krueger against Jason Voorhees, is far more horrible than horrifying. The only way that &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; might really be any fun is if these two avengers from beyond the grave decided to team up and go after the cast of  &quot;American Wedding.&quot; This dumb, only intermittently — sometimes even intentionally — funny sequel asks the question that since almost everything else from the 1980's has come back, why not the cynosures of the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series and the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies. But people are also nostalgic for the world of four television networks, Macaulay Culkin and anti-trust legislation, too  — that doesn't mean they're coming back. The smirky sauciness of Kreuger (Robert Englund) at least gives audiences something to root for, or against. The real problem is that Jason is a nobody whose face has been hidden from view for 20 years. There probably won't be a sequel to &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; — a concept that first surfaced over a decade ago, when both franchises had a trace of, well, blood, left.

Kevin Costner, directing with his usual root-canal humorlessness, is aiming for the stark, mythic grandeur of the old westerns, but &quot;Open Range&quot; succeeds only in feeling simplistic and puffed up. As an actor in other people's movies, Mr. Costner is at his best when he unleashes his raffish, reckless charm, letting the good man and the bad boy duke it out for pre-eminence. Under his own direction, though, his self-regarding piety always wins. Every pause, every gesture, every grimace is fraught with significance, so that even his cowboy reticence comes to seem like shameless showboating. Annette Bening's performance, unfortunately, is well matched to Mr. Costner's; if the two of them were any more upstanding they'd be trees. Some of the supporting actors, notably Robert Duvall and Michael Jeter, throw off a few sparks of levity, but neither they nor the well-executed final shootout can prevent the movie from suffocating in its earnest self-seriousness. — A.

Unfortunately Clark Johnson and a battery of writers have also retained the punitive monotony and barely coherent narrative thinness of the old show as well: it evokes the feeling of wasting a rainy Saturday afternoon. The foreign crime boss Alex Martel (Olivier Martinez) is about to be extradited after leaving a trail of corpses and misery. Following a failed jailbreak —  after which Martel inexplicably gets to speak to the television cameras —  he offers &quot;one hundred million dollars to whoever gets me out to here.&quot; And law and order in Los Angeles suddenly evaporates, with all of the city's thugs, gang-bangers and semi-employed, dangerous-looking actors marshalling their forces to spring Martel. An elite S.W.A.T. team has to transport this prisoner to either a federal pen, the airport or another film remake of an old Aaron Spelling television show. The S.W.A.T. team members —  LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt —  are so gung ho that in any other city they'd be subjected to steroid testing. Samuel L. Jackson plays the absurdly named team leader Hondo —  it comes from the old show —  with the Rhythm-Heritage confidence that burbles like the old-school funk of Mr. DeVorzon's theme. And Colin Farrell, employing a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal a step ahead of the authorities, stars as the S.W.A.T. officer Jim Street. Much of the by-the-yard martial choreography is strictly by-the-book, as Hondo's martinet captain might say. Mr. Johnson almost seems to be rejecting the fascist politics of the premise, and his discomfort is palpable, like Danny Glover's slight hesitations in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies. — Elvis Mitchell"

The mother must navigate the social minefield of high school, while the daughter is plunged into a frenzy of multi-tasking, juggling work, parenthood and an impending remarriage (to an upstanding fellow played by Mark Harmon). The measure of the film's integrity is how smoothly it modulates from wild farce to earnest sentiment, and the two — really the four — main performances are as dazzling as they are effortless.

One of them, the only child left in the local orphanage, dreams that a band of angels has come to town, and he tries to persuade them to take him away with them. At least this is what seems to be happening.

The voiceover narration by David McCullough, and the Ken Burns-style archival stills give it an air of public television worthiness that undercuts the excitement of the racing sequences. The story, of a runty, crooked-legged horse who became the biggest media celebrity in Depression-weary America, is impossible not to embrace, and Mr. Ross tells it with efficiency and professionalism. The movie is successful —  it gives you a sense of the times, and of the colorful human characters whose lives were entwined with Seabiscuit's — but it is also disappointing. The cast includes some of the finest actors working in movies today, but with the partial exception of Chris Cooper (as the horse's enigmatic, taciturn trainer), they are confined by the film's schematic, simplified storytelling. Jeff Bridges, as Charles Howard, Seabiscuit's owner, and Tobey Maguire, who plays his principal jockey, the unlucky Red Pollard, are both thoroughbreds.

It begins with Lucía narrating; she is about to board a plane with her husband, Ramón, for a Brazilian vacation. He disappears with the tickets as the flight is being announced. After the initial shock of her husband's broad-daylight vanishing wears off, she's forced to recognize that her marriage hadn't been a particularly happy one for some time. Ms. Roth's radiance and understanding of Lucía's emotional life gives this movie a touch of necessary psychological accessibility. Movies of this subgenre, in which the protagonist has to come to an understanding of herself by measuring her own life against her previous somnolent bourgeoisie existence, can feel vapid. This is partially because the star has to awaken from her own passivity before our very eyes. Ms. Roth makes Lucía's state a willful ignorance instead, and her emerging recognition of her unhappiness, as new information comes to light, adds a dimension to the material. The film also has two able, love-struck neighbors who lend her a couple of hands: Félix (Carlos Alvarez Novoa) &#151; a battered and elderly former political firebrand who still has a bit of a fuse left &#151; and Adrián (Kuno Becker), a 20-ish musician determined to prove his seriousness by quoting dense philosophical precepts at the most inopportune moments. Mr. Serrano stages his wobbly adaptation of Rosa Montero's novel &quot;La Hija del Canibal&quot; with lively, fast-moving efficiency.  Ms. Roth uses an anticipatory jitteriness, too, and gets to take a deep breath at the end of &quot;Lucía, Lucía.&quot; She deserves it, because she's kept the picture going. &#151; Elvis Mitchell"

The movie an awkwardly directed, unevenly acted and sloppily written. But adolescence is a sloppy, ungainly, awkward time, and after a while, the bad lighting, graceless editing, sluggish dialogue and self-conscious performances begin to seem like marks of authenticity, as if the movie had been made not just for and about teenagers, but by them.

Essentially, that's what &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; is all about, the American middle-class obsession of documenting innocuous daily life with eight-millimeter cameras and now videotape. Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove the footage into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and eight-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their homes and lives. Mr. Jarceki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment. He layers the story, setting up his premise early in the film — that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story. — Elvis Mitchell"

Convened to battle a world-threatening evil, the league is a group of tough, forgotten or ignored British loners brought together at the behest of the. The group is led by the legendary but aged hunter and explorer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), who, though well past his prime, is still capable of some world-beating moves. The other members include the pirate Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah); an invisible man, Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran, using his voice wickedly well); the vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson); the dandyish Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend); Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng); and the token American, an adult Tom Sawyer (Shane West), now an  operative for the United States Secret Service. Mr. Norrington shows glimmers of faith in Mr. Moore's melancholic and apocalyptic vision. Still, the movie suffers from its own anxiety: a dread of being too literate, if not too literary. That's an unintentionally hilarious failing, given the material's leaning on public domain book figures: in their way the Marvel comics heroes of their time. Somehow you sense that Fox would be happier calling this picture &quot;The <I>Justice</I> League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; As it stands, the movie is neither gentle nor extraordinary. — Elvis Mitchell"

In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell"

And old jokes is really what &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is all about. Reese Witherspoon returns as Elle Woods, the indefatigable sprig of a girl whose disposition is as sunshiny as her hair. Previously, she conquered Harvard Law School, a venue in need of a new world order, and in the nominal sequel, she takes on the moribund legislative branch in Washington. Elle is working as an aide to Representative Rudd (Sally Field), a fellow Delta Nu. Probably the funniest thing in the picture is seeing these Oscar-sized forces of nature: Ms. Witherspoon, the most determined actress of the 21st century, is posed pert nose-to-nose with Ms. Field, whose blurted &quot;You really like me&quot; sentiment disguised a will equally steely. But Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and the writer Kate Kondell don't make enough of this match-up. Instead, &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is repetitive rather than reiterative, going over the same material as the first. The snappy, happy Elle is ridiculed by Rudd's worldly and world-weary aides, especially the tough, crude Grace (Regina King). So, Elle has to wear them down, win them over, yet still find time to get married. The movie assumes not only that Elle did not learn anything from the first movie, but that its lessons of perseverance and open-mindedness were lost on audiences, too. — Elvis Mitchell"

To invoke the name of another underwhelming new film, &quot;Sinbad&quot; is legally bland. It stars Brad Pitt, who's such an actual avatar of golden-haired perfection that he's more credible as a cartoon; his under-inflected, slightly toasted-sounded arrogance seems less than fitting for a lusty, robust hero and con man and more in line with the stoner he played in &quot;True Romance.&quot; As it stands, kids will gravitate more toward his antic, commanding and inventive sidekick pooch. Or toward Eris, the capricious god of Chaos (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose need to stir up trouble isn't quite as grandiose as &quot;Sinbad&quot; requires. As Sinbad sails the film's marvelous computer-rendered seven seas on his mission, Eris conjures mischief. She's the otherworldly presence looming over the titular figure's peregrinations, and her mellifluous malevolence is one of the most distinctive elements the picture has to offer.

And so Arnold Schwarzeneggar returns once more from the future to deliver one-liners with his trademark leaden  whimsy. It has been 12 years since the last &quot;Terminator&quot; movie, and  nearly 20 since the first, and the franchise risks a certain obsolescence. As does the old T-1 himself; his nemesis this time is a sleek new model, T-X cyborg human-hunter (Kristanna Loken), who turns up naked on Rodeo  Drive and proceeds to wreak havoc in a red leather pants suit and a Lexus  sports coupe. Jonathan Mostow lacks the operatic humanism of James Cameron, who made the first two episodes, but he brings an air of unassuming B-movie  competence to the many chase and explosion scenes. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are the future resistance leaders whom the good terminator must protect from the bad one.

Four weeks after a laboratory full of rage-infected monkeys has been liberated by some tragically misguided animal-rights activists, the whole of London — and possibly every place else — has been substantially depopulated, leaving the few healthy survivors to contend with red-eyed, ravenous infecteds. The movie is suitably graphic and terrifying, but it also has some surprising pastoral moments, as the main characters flee London for the countryside. Anthony Dod Mantle's digital cinematography has an exquisite, painterly beauty that makes the picture not just scary, which it surely is, but genuinely haunting.

It would be fair to say that the movie is  better than both the television show that inspired it  as well as its film predecessor — and that's even a compliment.  Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu return as clumsy Natalie, boy-crazy Dylan and semi-prim Alex in a sequel whose sugar-rush absurdity almost defeats the forces of logic, taste and conventional narrative. It's as cheerfully, enjoyably humid as the first blast of summer light and heat. &quot;Throttle&quot; is so much like a feature-length cartoon that you may find yourself sitting through the end credits waiting to see who provided the voices for the — if you'll pardon the expression — characters. The idea that McG and the screenwriters use to inform the picture with an abiding sweetness is to treat the Angels like a family. But what carries more weight than any threat to the world — which they can overcome with one hand tucked into a thong behind their backs — is a peril to the bonds that hold the Angels together. And in &quot;Throttle,&quot; there are three looming dangers to Charlie's brood: one is the retired Angel-gone-renegade Madison Lee (Demi Moore), who's saddled with the traditional threat to national security. Another is Dylan's former lover, the Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux).

Unlike such gaudy, gleaming toys, in which the hoods have access to so many devices and fleets of automobiles that you wonder why they couldn't just retire on what they're spending on pulling off the crimes, the Australian-based film is set in a trough of despair. It features a few tart rip-off scenes and a performance of back-alley bravura by Guy Pearce in the lead as Dale, the thinking-man's hood who is the oldest of the Twentyman brothers, three accomplished thieves who are just about to be set free on bail. Their lawyer, the scheming, perfectly exfoliated Frank (Robert Taylor), who's arranging their release, has also set up a bank job for them and turns against them by its end. The rest of the film involves the brothers' getting pulled into another robbery after getting out of the joint, and using it to plot their comeback. &quot;The Hard Word&quot; is a series of snatches and betrayals, with a couple of surprises that aren't terribly hard to figure out.

However, since he's experiencing a writer's block that leaves his imagination colder than this picture's, Alex hires a stenographer, the all-business Emma (Kate Hudson), in the hope of dictating a book to her during his allotted time. There's so little chemistry between Mr. Wilson and Ms. Hudson that you begin to look back on what now seems like the halcyon days of &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.&quot; Ms. Hudson has to rifle her bag of tricks — that sleepy, slightly stoned squint as if she's trying to peer through the fog and find the truth — because Emma's not a character; she's a hand-me-down comic foil, a peanut butter cookie that will eventually crumble as she's dunked into a steaming cup of love. She's there to be a steadying hand on Alex's excesses, but she's such an obvious device that when she tells him his novel is filled with unfortunate coincidences, it's the pot calling the kettle bankrupt.

(As the angry green fellow hops through the desert, pursued by fighter jets, he looks more Claymation than computer-generated, and you half expect to see Wallace and Gromit in the cockpits.) Nor is it the witless writing or the hectic, inconsistent acting. Eric Bana's inertia is overcompensated by the trembling weepiness of Jennifer Connelly, who plays his soul mate, and the raving of Nick Nolte, as his dad, a mad scientist. These lapses would be forgivable if the filmmakers had found the right tone of pop seriousness to bring the hero and his story into focus.

Mr. Malkovich proves his devotion to actors, lingering on them during moments of silence. And the movie echoes its director's own deportment as an actor, alternating silky smoothness with burlap coarseness. The lawyer-turned-police-officer Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is tracking down a pack of guerrillas, led by the man known as Ezequiel. Ezequiel's career traces the same steps as Abimael Guzman, the philosophy professor turned leader of Peru's murderous Shining Path terrorist collective, right down to his capture. Determined, solicitous and calm, Rejas goes about his job, sifting through the wreckage — physical and emotional — left in Ezequiel's wake. Mr. Bardem plays Rejas with a morose wit, a cheekiness that registers almost as an afterthought. He exudes a weary professionalism because his manner is the only tool that keeps him from being subsumed by depression. Mr. Bardem's performance is different from anything he's done before — the vivacious Reinaldo Arenas of &quot;Before Night Falls,&quot; the brooding paraplegic of &quot;Live Flesh&quot; — characters who couldn't hide the tremors of emotion that rocked them to the very core.

Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are thinner and wirier than their predecessors, but their timing and energy are impressive, as is Peyton Reed's fanatical regard for the look, sound and tone of the old pictures. This one unfolds in a fairy-tale 1962 Manhattan, its streets thronged with boxy cabs and impossibly stylish dressers. What is missing, though, is the subtext of sexual and social panic that made the earlier movies so bracing in their silliness. Ms. Zellweger's proto-feminist firebrand, an apostle of sex without love and workplace equality, tangles with Mr. McGregor's playboy journalist, with matrimony the foreordained result. David Hyde-Pierce and Sarah Paulson are the neurotic second couple, and the romantic high jinks are fairly well managed.

And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn-Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, &quot;The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust,'' questions of identity - and the continual submersion of self to stay alive - are the heart of the story. &quot;Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear,'' says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. The narrative has the engrossing folds and twists of a novel. Hahn-Beer loses her true love to cowardice, her mother to the Nazis. Years later, she gains a family of her own, after assuming the identity of an Aryan she knew years earlier. She burrows so completely into this falsehood that she marries a kind German, who's also a Nazi sympathizer. (By the end of the war, he's drafted and she takes on the absurd and frightening position of the title of her book.) And she so deeply sublimates her feisty, fiery personality in playing the role of a compliant wife that she comes to love her second existence. Finally, what threatens to become a life sentence of self-abnegation is commuted because the man who loved Hahn-Beer and abandoned her earlier persuaded the young woman into hiding her real identity papers in the lining of a book. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn-Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism. — Elvis Mitchell"

The extremely flimsy connective tissue is Mr. Murphy, who barely bothers to do takes; he'll raise an eyebrow here and there, but he mostly uses a voice so smooth and warm, you could pour it over pancakes. And in this context — in which the very young audience is so primed to react to him as Eddie Murphy, it's surprising the kids in the cast don't call him Eddie — he can get away with it, because he knows that the movie will do most of the work for him; he's Beverly Hills Pop.

The 16-year-old Victor (Victor Rasuk) is all teenage assertion, but his machismo has training wheels.  In Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy, it's Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble. Pride is a tricky subject to make a film about. Part of what will leave you taking in all of the delights of &quot;Vargas&quot; with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household. Victor lives in a tiny apartment with his family, including his stubborn, salt-of-the-earth grandmother (Altagracia Guzman).  Things get complicated when Victor starts chasing the swan-like Judy (Judy Marte) and the whole world gets involved. In the larger world, this stuff might not add up to a hill of beans, but Mr. Sollett treats the emotional shifts in the Vargas household like the movement of tectonic plates; each change rocks the characters lives. — Elvis Mitchell"

Justin Lin, the writer and director of this shrewdly tense piece of storytelling, recognizes that sometimes it's good for a filmmaker to stir up trouble. He does so by taking the group most often orphaned into stereotypical behavior by teen films, Asian-Americans. Ben (Parry Shen), a naive grind of an overachiever, is pulled into an orbit of friends and small-time criminals. First comes a lucrative cheating operation, a hustle that gives the boys way too much spare cash to go along with their extra free time. And the kids find that their brains and ambition work just as well racking up the kinds of activities that don't look good on a college application. Their homeroom-based guile finally leads Ben, who eventually wants to break free, into one last, potentially liberating crime.

George Gallo intersperses interview clips of Mr. Griffin's family with a documentary taping of the comedian's stand-up act. The intent of the footage of the relatives seems to be an attempt to position &quot;Family&quot; as more than just a concert film. This is a better idea than the illustrative sound effects ladled over Mr. Griffin's act; he's hardly so subtle that his routines scream for embellishment. In &quot;Family,&quot; Mr. Gallo doesn't use much of the offstage material, which is too bad; it's just the right approach to offer insight into a stand-up like Mr. Griffin, whose cockiness is a dare, part arrogance and part fear.

His best material is autobiographical, like his assessment of Holy-Roller church services: &quot;Church is a concert for old people who don't get out too much.&quot; (The high-firepower profanity of his act will probably send quite a few people to church.)

A story that could have been milked for horror and suspense focuses instead on the girls' amazing resilience as they undertake the 1,200-mile trek home on foot.

A recent — very recent — decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was a co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over.

As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story — a revenger's tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Leonardo DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Daniel Day-Lewis) — is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth, the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is in the way it brings history to life — not merely by meticulously recreating its details, but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity.

Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth.

It's a German comedy about a workaholic chef who has to force herself out of her fixation and get a life. The movie succeeds because the writer-director, Sandra Nettelbeck, seems as obsessive as her titular heroine.  Martha (Martina Gedeck), a chef in an upscale Hamburg restaurant, is focused and good at her game. When her 8-year-old niece, Lina (Maxime Foerste), arrives at Martha's doorstep because her mother has been killed in a car accident, Martha doesn't know what to do.

It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood.

A couple of years ago, Mr. McTiernan devised a retooled version of Jewison's &quot;Thomas Crown Affair&quot; and now, he has produced an Extreme Sports version of Jewison's glum sci-fi anticapitalist fantasy film.  In this third-rate action film, Chris Klein plays a hotshot young athlete who is lured into Central Asia to play professional Rollerball, a sport combining polo, MotoCross and felony assault. Mr. Klein learns that life is cheap – the team owner (Jean Reno) exercises a no-trade clause in the most brutal way possible. Coming on the heels of the failed XFL, &quot;Rollerball&quot; is about as relevant as an expose on the inner workings of Roller Derby. As Mr. Klein's teammates, there's a relaxed LL Cool J and a surprisingly adept Rebecca Romjin Stamos, who can't quite keep her accent in check. – Elvis Mitchell

Billy Crystal plays the over-the-hill publicist who organizes a press junket at which all manner of not terribly surprising complications ensue.

This whimsical tall tale has a warmth and conviction lacking in some of the brothers' other movies, thanks to a soundtrack full of blues, gospel and country tunes that prove immune to pastiche or cynicism. — A.

Kennedy's right-hand man, Kenny O'Donnell — graciously bowing out of the way to allow the president (Bruce Greenwood) and his brother Robert (Steven Culp) center stage. Costner's moving to the sidelines is as ostentatious as his Boston Brahmin accent — he seems to be channeling Vaughn Meader. But the director Roger Donaldson, despite having more confrontation scenes than all of the other Kennedy dramatization projects combined, brings an athletic rigor to the film. The movie is helped by Greenwood's crisp, intense President Kennedy: he's like a White House portrait come to life. -- Elvis Mitchell

The movie takes the action form, which often attacks the screen with energy and movement, and creates a placid surface that offers a new perspective and a spirituality not normally found in these pictures. In terms of action nothing much takes place for the first 10 minutes. That's so he can set up the incredibly complicated plot, which has as much romance, intrigue, free-wheeling action   —   and rousing silliness   —   as any five Hong Kong throw-down fests. This is no small feat, given the dizzying amount of exposition in these movies.  Outrageous plot pile-ons certainly take place in &quot;Tiger&quot;   —   a practice as ritualistic as having a martial arts master and student square off against each other, also a part of the picture. Fans of the genre will giggle with delight over the canny way Lee handles the intersections, and audiences new to these films will shudder with excitement.

Michael Douglas is the new American drug czar, Catherine Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman.

It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into. Fortunately, the elegance of Philip Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time. Much of that élan comes from Geoffrey Rush, who plays Sade as a gleeful voluptuary unfettered by either morality or what for him would be the most venal of sins, sentimentality. Sade has been confined to the Charenton Asylum, and, for him, this is merely slumming, a time when he gets to evaluate the damaged and discarded psyches that litter the rooms and decide which is his most apt target.

Unfortunately, this loud, trashy updating of the 70's television show isn't as much fun as it should be, despite Ms. Diaz's spirited comic performance.

As played by Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Chris Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year. &#151; A.

The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Peter Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mel Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Julia Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. — Elvis Mitchell"

If the movie suffers severely from attention deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild), the screwball comic tone impeccably sustained and Ms. Ullman (putting on her Fern Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin) delightfully goofy. &#151; Stephen Holden"

''Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Jean Tripplehorn and Stellan Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide.

Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family.

But the movie is undermined by Brian De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Gary Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

Wes Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films ''The Blair Witch Project'' or ''The Sixth Sense,'' but rather ''Scream'' itself.

All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Me. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid Government agent is closing in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.

It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada. Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; — Stephen Holden"

The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,&quot; dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; glitches and all. Ralph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career. &#151; Janet Maslin"

That pairing irritates Paula (Dani Behr), who needs attention from Matt. Other pairings ensue as Craig is pushed into an intoxicating world of cocaine and expensive parties. Mr. Rose and Mr. Bell do fine jobs as the lovers, and Ms. Behr is convincingly arrogant and needy.

Though it breaks no ground — hardly surprising, given that its source, an 1857 novel by Paul Féval called &quot;Le Bossu&quot; (&quot;The Hunchback&quot;), has been adapted for the screen five times before — Mr. de Broca's film is full of durable cinematic pleasures: a little sex, a lot of sword fighting and a plot that combines heady passion with complicated political intrigue. — A.

His last film, ''Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a kind of perfection. The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie. &#151; A. O. Scott"

In a film that certainly keeps its audience guessing what might happen next (Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes?), John Turturro takes the cake as the most fiendish of bowlers. — Janet Maslin"

Despite the astonishing technological advances behind James Cameron's great visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the film's central illusion: that the audience is drawn back into the Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all its painstaking historical detail, this &quot;Titanic&quot; proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with real historical detail, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; -caliber ambitions, Mr. Cameron dared to dream of the impossible and came up with the movie of the year. - Janet Maslin"

Closer than ever to cartoon superhero status, James Bond this time appears in what could almost be a generic summer blockbuster, if not for its hero's being chronically overdressed. The Hong Kong action star Michelle Yeoh tries to kick some life into the proceedings, but the film is dominated by gadgets, monotones and explosions that happen on cue. Best supporting performers: Jonathan Pryce as a power-hungry media mogul, and a BMW that works on remote control.

Adapting Rick Moody's observant novel, the director of ''Sense and Sensibility'' uses his own quiet acuity to make a Connecticut bedroom community, circa 1973, seem as strange and distant as any Austeniana; no, much more so. Beautifully and mournfully acted, especially by those who play the women of this well-heeled Pompeii.

And a good portion of &quot;Sick&quot; consists of excerpts from videotaped performances in which his collaborator and companion of 15 years, Sheree Rose, lovingly puts him through his paces. Not for the faint of heart. &#151; Stephen Holden"

Following the ''Nashville'' blueprint, Paul Thomas Anderson explores the quaint customs and inchoate longings within an insular pop subculture, this time the sleazy, druggy universe of 70's porn. From spectacular party sequences to clear proof that the party is over, this busy, wildly colorful film has no trouble holding interest -- far from it. But its extravagant length is a tactical mistake, since it promises bigger ideas than Mr. Anderson delivers. Mark Wahlberg gives a terrifically appealing performance in the story's tricky central role. Prominently featured in the fine ensemble cast are Burt Reynolds, doing his best and most suavely funny work in years as a porn auteur, and Julianne Moore as his ethereal, vaguely tragic star. Minor details, like her hilariously bad porn acting or the flashy period costumes, are an evil treat. — Janet Maslin"

Brightly acted and casually hilarious, the film exploits this gimmick in witty, trenchant ways that are always generous, never cruel. Peter Cattaneo's winning feature debut understands that joblessness is a humiliation well beyond nakedness, but it also revels in the sight of downtrodden ex-workers learning to enjoy their new freedom.

It is also a computer- and video-age tribute to Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film ''Blow Up'' that explores the limitations of truth as revealed through pictures. Bill Pullman is bracingly feisty as a producer of action-adventure films whose macho brio is shattered after he is carjacked and nearly killed, and he goes into hiding. Andie MacDowell is his neglected wife who seizes his empire after his disappearance. Gabriel Byrne is the ambivalent mastermind behind an elaborate surveillance system that the Government is secretly testing in Los Angeles. While monitoring that system, he is witness to a crime he doesn't understand. Ry Cooder composed the gorgeous, shivering musical score. &#151; Stephen Holden"

John Schultz brings a fond, knowing perspective to the world of the garage band, but his previous experience making promotional documentaries about Steven Spielberg movies also shows. Sweet and rueful, with a fresh, likable cast, solid comic timing and a chatty tone that owes much to Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith. Matthew Hennessey, as the group's drummer, shows off a slacker's gift of gab, while Kevin Corrigan plays a more stoned, seasoned rocker with a body that goes fishing, a mind ''somewhere between the tangerine trees and the marmalade skies.'' This breezy independent film places as high a value on spontaneity and freedom as its characters do. A laid-back good time. — Janet Maslin"

John Travolta, still on his astonishing second-act career role, plays Ms. Penn's exasperated new husband (after the first marriage has understandably exploded) and expertly brings the story back to planet Earth.

These qualities are embodied not only in Mr. Campbell's haunted eyes and sunken lips but also in a rich musical voice whose oratorical roll enfolds many quivering notes, including several shades of hysteria. Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling. - Stephen Holden

In her new environs the girl combats her grief by taking over a bunch of goose eggs uprooted by a developer's bulldozer, helping them hatch and, in a charmingly unsentimental story of a girl and her birds, raising the goslings. Later Thomas devises a flying machine that helps instruct the geese how to fly south for the winter. The film turns a potentially treacly children's story into an exhilarating 90's fable. -- Janet Maslin

But its foreigness has perverse advantages, helping to receast situations that might seem commonplace in an American end-of-adolescence movie, and making them just remote enough to seem fresh. The director, Franc Roddam, lends the film a clarity of emotion that keeps it from becoming too confusing. - Janet Maslin
